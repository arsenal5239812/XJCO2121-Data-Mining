"Huawei P8 Lite US Version- 5 Unlocked Android 4G LTE Smartphone - Octa Core 1.5GHz, Dual SIM, Gorilla Glass, 13MP Camera - White (U.S. Warranty)",Huawei,198.99,4,"Excitement Begins with unboxing!Amazing box and packing!Pros:-Incredible multi-tasker.-Good design and built.-Both cameras are good. Work flawlessly. Good night time photos.-Nice UI. But better get a launcher.-Comes Preinstalled with screen guard.-Superb gaming experience.-Very nice screen , resolution and display.Cons:-Battery back up is moderate.Update::Using this phone for around one month.Battery:My impression is the battery takes few charging cycle to work to its full potential. After few days of terrible battery back up i am getting around 15 to 18 hours of battery back-up when my wi-fi, 4g lte are on with auto on brightness mode . I remember it was my 10th day with the phone. I took out phone from charging at 10 a.m. wi-fi 4g lte both on. Used gps and navigation for an hour, streamed youtube video for 3 hrs. one hour of gaming. listened to audio songs for two hours and at 1 a.m. in the night battery was 18 %. So it takes battery to tune to its best performance a few good days. But it is done it will easily last a day of moderate use.Camera:The quality of camera and photos taken by it are subjected to different views and opinions depending on the previous smartphone you used. So if somebody is crying over camera quality he/she mus be using flagship phones. However, if somebody is using smartphone for first time or this phone comes as a upgrade to his/her previous phone then the person will be more than happy for the camera. The 13 megapixel camera shoots amazing photos. Even photos in night or in dim light or dark are fantastic. No graining of photos. One of my friend was surprised to see the photos taken in complete darkness and he uses nexus 5. 5 MP front camera does perfect job for selfies.If you cannot reach the button to take selfie while holding the phone just go to the setting in camera and switch on the option of capturing the smile. Just give a smile and no need of pressing any button. Only you have to do is hold the phone in position.Processor(hardware) and performance:This phone is powered by tried and tested Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor. Amazing thing to have on your phone! It comes with 1.5 Ghz OCTA-core processor. Since i am a student (pursuing my PhD) i hardly play games . So not aware about high end gaming on this phone. But i do play NFS no limits more often. Even with facebook, messenger, messaging, whatsapp and the game working on same time, few hundred MB ram is always available phone never seems to lag. For moderate and light use like using navigation , messenger, facebook, whatsapp on on the same time the phone will not lag. Transition from one app to another is very fluid. Sometimes phone hanged for a second or two but started working as usual after that. If you are a hardware and performance geek then go to some website offering technical reviews based on different test and numbers. It will give better idea. It has array of sensors which includes Accelerometer, Compass, GPS, A-GPS, GLONASS, Proximity Sensor and gyroscope.Software:Amazon website says it comes with kitkat but fortunately i got it with pre-installed lollipop spiced up by huawei's emotion UI. The emotion UI is light and is inspired from ios. It will show your apps on the homescreen. I did not like it. So went to the play store and installed launcher. ( Now i am using nova launcher). The UI is very fluid , transitions and animations are good too. This does not overwhelm the base android experience. Fortunately Huawei is professional and do not stuff your phone with bloatwares. The only preloaded apps i got were flashlight, voice recorder, phone manager,back up etc. Really helpful! Never wanted to uninstall them nor are they battery guzzler.Screen:It is a bliss. 720p display is not bad as it sounds. Watching casual videos, complete movies is a fun. Photos are very clear to look at. You will never pixels.If you want to see them get a very good magnifying glass. Otherwise screen is very amazing.Design and feel:Design is nice , simple and basic and yet attractive. The feel is plasticky but not cheap. The phone is very light and sometime does not give you satisfaction of holding your phone. Tends to slip from hand until you get used to the grip. After few days of use feels nice in hand. It is unbelievably light weight. But not rugged. Therefore i will recommend some rugged dual layer back cover for the phone. You don't have to worry about screen though as it comes pre-installed with a screen protector. And phone has Corning Gorilla glass 3. Literally scratch proof but not shatter proof. One more reason to get a good back cover! This will increase the overall weight of the phone for good reason.Miscellaneous:This phone is wonderful. This a huge upgrade over my previous lumia 520. It had 512 MB ram 840p display. Worked wonderful for 2.5 years but with win 8.1 update it started to lag. Camera went bad. Nut it was rugged as compared to my new p8 lite. Dropped it for many times over height of 5 to 6 feets. Screen never broke. Just a single scratch in 2.5 years without any screen protector.My new huawei has everything which was missing on lumia 520. Camera with more megapixels and better sensors, dual flash,front camera, 2 gb ram , lag free performance, larger 5"" screen. And at last but not the least android.My friends have asus zenfone 2 , moto g3. These phone only betters p8 lite in terms of battery back up , asus's larger screen and moto's stock android and waterproof abilities.However in terms of performance they are not even closer to P8 lite. Asus has stalled the performance of zenfone with many pre-installed apps even though it has better specifications.Moto g3 looks better in some aspects. But my friend started complaining that there phones are hanging despite of 2 or 3 gb of ram. The p8 lite never seems to hang . I am using for a month. Hanged or stuttered twice. But got out of it without any external input from me and started working as usual that is in fantastic way. Plus huawei offers 2 years of warranty. Even if you have any problems you don't have to worry about your phone. They have dedicated call center for their products. Plus phone also has pre-installed app to call for support. This phone comes with dual sim abilities which supports 4g LTE and also has memory card slot which support card upto 128 gb. Huawei has made arrangements such that you may run out of data you will not run out of the space to store it. You can transfer apps to sd card. Overall it is complete package and will recommend it to my friends and family. At a price around 210$ no one comes around.",2.0

Samsung Galaxy i537 S4 Active Unlocked Smart Phone - Urban Gray (No Warranty),Samsung,159.99,4,"Overall I'm really happy. I brought this unlocked AT&T phone over to Straight Talk under the BYOP program and for the most part, no issues. BUT, I did have one big problem upgrading from Kit Kat to Lollipop. The update kept failing and I had to bring it into Best Buy to get it to update. Now it solved other issues I was having (like it kept forgetting wifi passwords), but now its having GPS tracking problems. Also there is a lot of AT&T bloatware on this thing. My advice: Don't upgrade. Root, flash a custom rom that you like and get rid of all the bloatware.I've dropped this a bunch of times and the only thing that broke so far is the Samsung memory card (still pissed Samsung is dragging their butt with their warranty claim on this one).",1.0

"Motorola Moto X Developer GSM Edition Factory Unlocked Phone, 32GB, Black/Woven White",Moto X,235.0,4,Not much to say that has been said already. One of the best phones I have ever used. The phone is extremely efficient at multi tasking its OK for games when your in a waiting room. Its a really smooth experience. The only problems I have with it are. 1 I wish the screen was brighter in direct sunlight. To be fair no phone I have used ever passed that test though. 2 its half way into 2015 and still no Lollipop not to big of a deal but still. The camera is hit or miss. Somtimes it takes good pictures and sometimes it doesn't. If you fool with it you can get a decent photo but its not convenient like just flicking your wrist and snapping a shot. It should just be fluid as that no fooling around with where your standing because the auto HDR is crap. With those aside this is a great a phone very well made. I will probably get another moto x when the time co!es I really like this phone and what it has to offer so I will be sticking with the X line for awile.,0.0

Worked pretty well over last year and was pretty satisfied with it overall.Things i didn't like:- Battery life started ok, but by 8-9months was struggling to get through a day without charging, and without being a heavy user (never used it for music, movies, streaming, games etc)- Disliked that you could not mark an SMS as unread (to deal with later), despite this being on my first Motorola phone close to 15years ago.- Disliked that you could not add/change the alarm and ring tones, leaving alarm (a key feature for me on a phone) as choice between mostly horrible, uninspiring and tinny electrical noisesThing i really didn't like:- 1 year and 2 weeks after purchase (eg: just after warranty ran out), phone completely died without any warning or previous problems. Phone randomly turned off, and i had a day with just a black screen. Now it boots as far as the Motorola logo, and stays there for hours. All my data/files that was not google-linked have been lost.

So many different Xperia Z Ultra listings. I was afraid I would buy the wrong one. It arrived. I live in Boise, ID. I took my T-Mobile SIM card from my current phone and placed it in the Z Ultra. It came up! It took a few minutes for me to figure out how to SELECT PROVIDER and then even after that it seems like 30 minutes passed before I could figure out how to turn on DATA. Anyway, I got it figure out - IT WORKS! Using LTE (little symbol above reception bars says so). I installed OOKLA's Speed Test and got 69Mb/s download! I can't get that all the time. Maybe a fluke. I have exceeded 50 a couple times and always get more than 20. Point is, it IS USING THE LTE NETWORK!! Very happy with the feel. IT IS HUGE! Very nice display. Found some newsgroups that say it will be upgraded to Lollipop (Android 5.0). Currently has 4.4.4 and works great. Ordered some charging cradles/docs here on Amazon for the Z-Ultra. They were only $20. That way I won't need to peel back the waterproof cover over the USB port each night when I charge. I have only had it a few days, but the charge has lasted all day without getting low (stayed above 50%). And because it is new, I am always fiddling, so pretty good battery. Very happy! Works with T-Mobile!",4.0

The phone does everything that we need, like BlackBerry messaging, texting, phone calls, and surfing the net.Pros:1) Small and compact as compared to other Blackberry products.2) Battery lasts a good two days on standby, and a full day with moderate use (with 2+ hours of talktime)3) Screen is small, but brightCons:1) Trackpad (or whatever it is termed) can be very difficult to use, even after adjusting the sensitivity inputs. If you are constantly scrolling through applications, the whole exercise can become very frustrating. From other reviews the regular ""ball style"" roller of other BlackBerry's seems to work a whole lot better.2) No Skype application yet. Unlike other BlackBerry devices I have not found a native Skype application for this phone.3) SureType, the built in autofill logic, has been difficult for us to learn. You do have the option to turn this off though.4) Handset ear speaker can be a bit low at times; sometimes its difficult to hear the conversation.Overall if your looking for a BlackBerry for work applications, I would not recommend this phone. If your looking for a compact phone with most BlackBerry functionality, I would recommend this phone.",0.0

Verizon Samsung Alias 2 U750 No Contract Dual-Flip e-ink QWERTY Phone Black,Samsung,114.79,1,"I purchased this phone from this seller for the reason of the high ratings for customer satisfaction, but I completely thing this place is awful. The shipping was under estimated and on top of that, the phone is faulty. It was under the lable ""good condition"" and is was said to have ""minor scratches"" but it does deserve that title.When I opened the box of the phone, it of course had the minor scratches as promised, but one of the outlets cover (like where you would charge the phone) was broken, AND on top of that, the back cover didn't close all the way which meant the battery falls out all the time.That was just the outside of the phone. When using the phone for the first few days, I found out that it would freeze up. It was completely unusable, and the only way to be able to use the phone was to take the battery out and power it back up in a few minutes. After a few months I found out that the phone would completely shut off if I closed it the wrong way which is annoying when I finally realize that my phone is off after a few hours and people are trying to get ahold of me.The charger that came with it (which was also promised) was extremely cheap and stopped working after a few weeks.I am not an avid phone user. I rarely take my phone with me, so it stays home about 95-90% of the time. I rarely use my phone too. I am not rough on it. It stays on the table, so I think the condition it is in is unacceptable. I payed around 74 dollars for it and never EVER would I have wasted my money on this.I have no idea how this company has had achieved such positive feed back.

Studio 7.0 LTE - Smartphone - GSM Unlocked - White,BLU,,4,"Can this device replace my 2012 Nexus 7""? I can say with confidence that it's doing a fine job at it, and in a much better form factor as well. My 2012 Nexus 7 tablet had basically become unusable over the last year due to bad software updates that made it so laggy my 3 yr daughter whines about how slow it is.A little disclaimer: I have had a lot of Android devices over the years and I've found that low powered devices like the Studio 7.0 LTE benefit greatly from some simply optimization. This device with it's meager 1GB of RAM would be close to unbearable otherwise. It might also resolve some of the instability issues I've read throughout the comments, as I've had none after a month of use. Upon booting up the device I let it do it's factory 'update', once complete I do a full factory 'reset' so that it's initial boot is with the latest Android software, not just with an update (I rarely have stability issues with this practice). Next I either remove or disable ALL apps and programs I don't think I'll be using (do a google search if your unsure, most of it is bloatware). Another trick I don't expect most users to know about is going into 'developer settings' and changing the two or three 'animation' settings from 1.0x to 0.5x, this just makes things appear quicker on an interface level.ReviewThe Feel: Well first impressions are everything, and I suppose with rather low expectations at first (keep in mind it's only $110 device) I was a little surprised. It's a much more manageable size than my Nexus 7 and it's reasonably stylish in the dark blue I have. It doesn't feel too heavy or light in the hand, but still feels solid in its build. There is a little bit of creaking when gripped tightly but I suspect that's coming from the plastic back cover, which I don't believe is removable. Although the screen has a lower resolution it's bright enough to be in direct sunlight and has decently vivid colors. Contrary to a lot of reviews the speaker on my device is plenty loud for games or media consumption.Performance: Well...it gets the job done. Opening apps for the first time can take a little bit, but once in the app it does what it's supposed to without much stutter otherwise. With only 1GB of RAM don't expect this device to hold too many apps in the background, 3 at most. GAMING! I've downloaded Max Pain Mobile, Tombraider 1 (pc port), and Oddworld Stranger's Wrath, all of which are 3D games. All play without an issue and are smooth and fluid. I connected my Moga controller and actually beat Max Pain in 3 days time, a first for me on any AAA title, it was fun. So yeah, it does gaming likely thanks to the common Qualcomm 410 chip in it.The Ugly: For a device this cheap we all know there's going to be a corner cut here or there. The obvious being the camera. It can be made a tad bit more usable with a clever app, but not by much. It's basically a potato. Again, remind ourselves it was only $110. My biggest gripe is the light bleed on the screen. This will change dramatically between individual units, but in low light with brightness anywhere near half you're going to see the light bleed. It's most apparent for things like letterboxed media.Wait it's a phone too right? Per the title and my use this device is more of a tablet than anything to me, media consumption, browsing, and e-book reading. That said I did take this ""sort of obscene for its size"" phone out into the wild for a few days. Battery life is outstanding even with heavy use I was getting 5+ hours of screen on time. I use a GoPhone plan and I actually got a better signal with this device than any other I've used so far, which is impressive. I can't say much about talking on this phone. I rarely use my phone for talking and didn't need to much while testing it. It's awkward to hold up to the face, but I'm sure someone out there has the cranium size where this phone is a perfect fit, I'm close but not quite.",0.0

"CNPGD [U.S. Office Extended Warranty] Smartwatch + Unlocked Watch Cell Phone All in 1 Bluetooth Watch for iPhone Android Samsung Galaxy Note,Nexus,htc,Sony White",CNPGD,49.99,1,"It's not great, but definitely neat. I have an iPhone so Apple isn't exactly cooperative as they have their own products they have spent millions developing. The speaker isn't loud, and the corded headset is awkward and earbuds are hard to use. Phone calls work, but I did have to put the watch up to my ear to hear clearly at one point. The Bluetooth range is short approximately 10 feet. It works great through my phone via Bluetooth for music and talk through other Bluetooth speakers that are also sync to my phone. I got a micro sd card and put music on it, it only plays in file manager. Hooked up to a Bluetooth speaker on its own, it skips and sound quality is poor. It's so bad, I now want to return it. This makes it the worst MP3 player I've ever had, considering the wired headphones are very uncomfortable. I haven't tried to pair it with my newer Toyota yet. I bought this just to see if a smart watch is something I would like. $50 is cheap enough considering what I'm going to be spending on a nice watch. It's helping me figure out what I want. I've already seen a lot better watches on Amazon, w cameras. I paid $38 for this watch, it was too much, and the price went up since I bought it.

LG G3 D855 16GB (FACTORY UNLOCKED) - No 4G in USA - International Version No Warranty (Gold),,349.99,2,"Disappointing - I love the phone for the first day - such a nice upgrade vs my galaxy S2 - but then BIG software issue - even worse when I upgraded to Lollipop. factory reset - back to Kitkat - bit better but still not perfect. I ended up keeping my old phone but played with the G2 a bit more - and it is a disappointment overall. Software + hardware issues..not a great combo - LG you can do better I am sure! The screen is amazing to watch movies / pictures / browse and the battery life is pretty solid though. The vendor dealt with my issues swiftly though - appreciated it.Pros:* Gorgeous screen - if you can get your hands on 4K HD source it looks incredible. HD movies look also fantastic. This is one of the standout feature of the phone* Great camera* Good battery life (well, for a smartphone - I am still waiting for a smartphone that can last for 3 or 4 days straight)Cons:* BIG software issues: viber, whatsapp, facebook, any app that connects to the internet, are working on and off and wifi calling is often unavailable. the phone I received comes as an unlocked T-mobile phone with some T-mobile app that you cannot uninstall. Not a big deal in theory - but seems like the T-mobile settings get in the way of wifi calling* Other software issue - while in general the phone/android runs smoothly, once in a while the phones freezes / apps shut down / keyboard doesn't pops out when you want to type. Same things started on my Galaxy S2, after 3 years of use. Not right out of the box* SCREEN RESPONSIVENESS ISSUES. Every now and then the keyboard doesn't work. You type but nothing appears on the screen. My sister had a screen responsiveness issue with her LG G2 - the bottom home/back/switch buttons ended up not working after a while, while the rest of the screen was ok. Maybe a specific pb of LG phones? Is it a pb with the screen itself or the software I am not sure.* Power-button: I don't like the power button to be on the back of the phone - much easier if it is on the side. bit awkward to power on/off, especially as the phone has a large body.

The IRULU is just not ready for primetime: the build quality is less than what you pay for and software is a daily problem e.g. the phone does not complete the call and refreshes so you have to try to attempt the same call over and over or close the app and try again...what a phone that makes it hard to make calls (so 1 star for the IRULU).

The battery life is as stated. Pretty much last me the entire day. The screen is clear and bright and highly responsive. Wasn't a big fan of the app drawer not being available but I have gotten so use to not having it, I actually don't miss it. The internal space is much more that I could ask for not to mention the 3gigs of Ram power I have at my disposal. The camera is super clear, may not be the best compared to other but it does put up a challenge, even in low lighting. Also the dedicated shutter button is very convenient where it is placed. I think i will hang on to this phone for a while until BLU plans to make an upgrade to this. One again I am super pleased.",0.0

"Neoix RAKKAUS 4G LTE Quad Core Unlocked Smartphone 5.5"" HD Display, Black",Neoix,149.29,3,"1-15-16 ..This will be an ongoing review of Neoix Rakkaus phone . Phone arrived 3 days after order in good condition . Nice box with quick start guide ,charger, (2) screen protectors, one already installed , ear buds and short and long usb cords for wall mount charger. I was hoping the phone would have a manual but it did not. Quick start guide was very basic. Battery was not installed and was not even partially charged. I would like to also note that I sent two different emails to Neoix with questions about phone after purchase and neither have been answered yet. One question was about a phone case. I noticed in the questions section that they replied a case would be sent with new purchases. I did not receive one.Now on to the phone review. So far , it seems very fast and very nicely laid out on the home pages. Controls are familiar and work flawlessly so far. I had no problem connecting to my wifi or setting up to my straight talk provider. So far I am happy with the phone. Not so much with the seller at this point. Will update again soon.8/13/16Well The phone is still working but there are issues. First , this phone will randomly delete my contacts. Then sometimes when I search for a contact , it doesn't find it but when they text or call they reappear. Volume is not very loud for ringer. Talk volume is fine . Phone sometimes won't download pics during texting. Even if on wifi. That along with the fact that it is not going to upgrade to marshmallow is very disappointing. I had high hopes but I am currently looking for another phone. Dropped rating from 4 starts to 3",14.0

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,4,"I am a long time Palm Pilot user who is moving to a Smartphone, and I chose this because I wanted an unlocked phone that I could use through NET10 or some other provider that does not lock you into a contract.At this point, my phone works fine and I'm pleased with the purchase. However, it was not a ""plug and play"" process and I made one mistake. The description of this product didn't make it clear which size SIM card you need. For this model, you need the larger sized SIM card (I think it's called a mini card) from your carrier, and the smaller sized card (micro card?) for additional storage (optional). That mistake cost me $15 but not a significant tragedy.In my case, the provider also didn't seem to know how to get this phone to use the data services needed for internet connections or apps without using wi-fi. Once I read up on GSM networks and saw that it's a 2G technology, I remembered an option in settings for ""only use 2G connections."" Once I tried that option, I had could browse the Internet.The GPS capability and the Navigation app are very nice. It works well enough for me in the car (especially with a slip case that prevents the phone from slipping around on my leg or car seat).It seemed a little rocky at first but I think that anybody with some tech savvy and some patience can get this phone set up. If you're not technically inclined, I'd recommend either going for a locked phone from a traditional carrier or finding somebody who can help you out.",2.0

Apple iPhone 5s 32GB (Gold) - T-Mobile,Apple,210.0,5,"I was a little skeptical at first about buying this phone from amazon because i got it at the price $499 (brand new!! Sealed) but i couldn't be happier! The phone of course is running ios 7 straight from the box and the touch i.d is probably the best thing ever. If you're debating whether to get the 5c or 5s definitely spend a little more for the 5s its totally worth it. The camera is great. Extremely fast and extremely clear. There are new options on it like the slomo effect which is fun to play with. The dual tone flash takes mobile picture taking to a whole other level. The best camera on a phone in the market. Take that from someone who has had a galaxy note 2 and samsung galaxy s3. The screen size is something people might not want to over look. If you have extremely big hands i would say go in store and try it out, see how well you can operate it. But its definitely ""one handable"" meaning you can use it with only one hand and not ever have to over stretch. The resolution is crystal clear, no doubt about that. Although the phone is 1.2 ghz it is blazing fast. It is a 64 bit. I can play heavy games like GTA and not ever freeze on me, even with lots of apps running in the background. Battery life is as expected when dealing with apple. But one thing i have noticed standby times are incredibly great. I can go to sleep with my phone at 100% and wake up and its at 99% sometimes still 100%. This phone is not ""droppable"" you'll have lucky moments when you drop it and it doesn't shatter but if it falls too high and too hard or at the wrong angle, your screen will be gone. Though I've had mine for over a month I haven't cracked it because i always keep it in a case. So invest in something protective like a speck case or otterbox or some generics.",56.0

I decided to not renew a contract and switch to Net10 a few months ago, and shortly thereafter damaged my HTC One X beyond being reasonable to fix.So, I began to shop for smartphones with features similar to what I was used to and was generally shocked at pricing. So, that is how I ended up ordering this phone.After putting in my sim card, the device worked immediately with my network. The display is wonderful, and the camera seems to be above average. I had no issues with the APN settings, but I downloaded the Net10 app that walks through the set up. Time will tell when it comes to battery life.My only complaint thus far is that there doesn't seem to be an option for ""swype"" when using the keyboard, which is a big complaint from me.

"Blackberry Curve 9370 Unlocked Phone Unlocked GSM with OS 7, 5MP Camera, GPS and Wi-Fi - Black",,164.99,5,"As noted by others, this phone can only be used if it is first activated by Verizon, meaning I had to be a Verizon customer, which I expected. It works fine. It was also unlocked as promised, and I found I could do talk and text on AT&Ts network with a good SIM card, which I had. I could not successfully use it for GSM data, although the phone indicated it was receiving EDGE. It is possible that it would have worked for data if I contacted AT&T or Blackberry, but I did not try this because I intend to use the phone on Verizon. I do not know if the phone will still work on GSM if I deactivate it on Verizon and I think this would be an interesting thing to know. There is a menu on the phone which makes it easy to switch between Verizon and GSM. The phone is excellent on the Verizon network, and the camera and music player are very good, as is the web surfing. The only thing needing improvement is the battery life. Also, it is not built as solidly as my prior BB 8530 but all in all, I am very satisfied with the seller and the phone.",0.0

"Sony Xperia Z5 Dual E6683 3GB/32GB 23MP 5.2"" 4G LTE Smartphone (White) - International Stock No Warranty",Sony,397.0,5,I upgraded from Xperia z2 to this Dual Sim z5. Im very happy with this purchase. It was a logical upgrade as most of everything is the same- however Sony has made decent upgrades. the exposed charging port is 100% better then the old hidden under a flap on the side of the phone. Also the Finger print reader works flawless and is hidden under the power button on the side. Speed and performance wise ill say the Snapdragon 810 is a mild improvement then the Snapdragon 801 in the z2. I have noticed the phone gets much warmer when i have it doing tasks such as backups or downloading larger files while doing other tasks as surfing the web. However being a water resistant phone cooling it off is as easy as running cool tap water over the front and back of the phone. Battery life has also been more or less the same. I can get a full days of use without much issueUsing the Dual sim feature is awesome as i dont need to carry 2 phones around. this phone also makes it easy to switch between sims 1 and 2 without physically handling the sim cards.,9.0

Headset cable is very short, not comfortable to use, so first thing i tried to do is to get adapter and try to use different phones. No way. Headset socket is so deep inside, that no adapter can work with is properly, so I'm stick with ugly short headset, and I have very good headphones which' I cannot use with it. Another problem, i noticed, GPS doesn't work. I wrote to store, they immediately answered and suggested to root phone and to change config. When I buy phone I expect it to work out of the box. Another problem with Skype - loud speaker during Skype session cannot be turned on so if you use camera, you are stick with headphones. Not comfortable. ""Back"" button sometimes is not reacting, I have to press it several times. I'll never buy such phone again.Update: I rooted this phone, tried to fix GPS, installed FasterFix, other software, it became a little better, but still, it takes very long to fix.

"BLU Studio 6.0 Unlocked Cellphone, White",BLU,971.6,5,"I received the phone a few days ago. This phone will replace my Samsung Mega 6.3. I plugged in a Family Mobile SIM card. The phone has had zero problems making or receiving calls or sending/receiving text messages. The phone also matches my girlfriend's Galaxy S3 in 2G/EDGE/HSPA+ coverage. T-Mobile uses Band 2, Band 4 and Band 12 for LTE coverage. This phone only picks up Band 4 LTE so there are places where I end up with HSPA+ while my girlfriend gets LTE. This does not seem to affect the speed of our internet connection very much as T-Mobile throttles prepaid and MVNO accounts to 6Mbps making LTE a moot point. The display quality and responsive interface is a huge upgrade from the Samsung Mega 6.3. For more advanced users I will note there is a huge lack of bloatware in this device. If you want to clear out the remaining unused apps then you can download Kingoroot from XDA forums and easily root the phone without a PC.If you do not see an update to this review in the next few weeks then you should assume the phone continues to work flawlessly.I also have Cricket in my Galaxy Note 4.

My old phone had been dropped so many times I had to tape it together to keep the battery in. I finally stopped in at Best Buy to have them help me transfer my stuff from my old phone to my new phone.

This phone is really, really good. I've put this phone through the paces and it has not a slowed down or freeze, and it does everything that my expensive Galaxy S6 edge Does. come on think about it for 450 you get a premium build phone with a great processor, really good screen, fast charging 2.0 which trust me it's amazingly fast, ZTE BUILD IN phone insurance and the only phone in the states with HI FI sound. I suggest you opt for the 64 Gb, version, but honestly I can't think of a single reason edgy not to recommend this phone.I've been using this phone for a few weeks and I have to say that I love it. I've owned iPhones and galaxy phones for the last 5 years but I don't think I will be doing that any more, they are not worth all that money; frankly, I hope ZTE continues to release more great phones like this in the near future.",5.0

First it did not work out of the box, next the seller refused to take it back without restocking fee and me paying for return shipment. AT&T said that it was not unlocked properly and certainly not done by Samsung but was done (attempted) probably by the Seller after importing it into US (evidenced by the pins of the wall charger) which already voided the OEM warranty.So instead of incurring the restocking fee and return postage I took to a local guy who did the unlock but regardless he said this will not run on USA 4G network unless unlocked properly by Samsung.

Also, the associate also told me 5300 calls were made from this phone and the phone had been activated before. Great news to hear after I spent money on a ""new"" phone. The next problem came about a week later when the phone completely stopped charging. Leaving me to switch batteries with my husband so he could charge the dead one. Brought this back to the same sprint dealer, they informed me that the complete usb charging port in the phone had been damaged and there were no sodder(sp)left on it. Seriously?

Moto Z Play - Black - 32GB (U.S. Warranty),Motorola,449.99,5,"I've been using Motorola since December of 2014. I started out using the 2nd gen Moto G, then to the 3rd and then the 4th, and now this. I thought they were fast and simple, but this? I've been missing out.Speed: Lightning feels ashamed. I've done side/side tests with other phones and it remains to be the king. I've never used anything this fast (only thing that might beat it is the Pixel, but I have yet to try that out).Screen: perfect for my uses. Cant tell the difference between this and ""quad HD"" except for color. This is still bright and vivid, and I can't find any flaws.Storage: if I could have gotten 64 GB, i would have, but It isn't out(yet?).Camera: it's a great camera, but it is not the best out there. Does that really matter, though? It's still a really nice shooter.Battery: That's where it really shines. Everything else is great, but this? It's almost unreal. I was working on a history project with my friend, and I got 6.5 hours of screen on time with 42% battery left. I'm ecstatic about this.Conclusion: GET IT. No phone can rival this battery life (yet?) and the performance is still the same par. Seriously. If you're looking for a new phone, look no further.

"Neoix RAKKAUS 4G LTE Quad Core Unlocked Smartphone 5.5"" HD Display, Black",Neoix,149.29,5,"This phone is pretty great. I brought it because of it's mSD slot, color, and cell quality, and let me tell you, it exceeded my expectations. Now, this isn't a ""flagship killer"" or anything silly like that, but this smartphone certainty is a nice budget phone that, within the scope of web browsing, video watching, music listening, and file transferring, has secured it's place as the perfect alternative.The camera is decent, call quality is superb, but their are problems with this phone.For one, the stock launcher for this phone is pretty unappealing. I would suggest an alternative like the Google Launcher, Go Launcher, Apex Launcher, etc. Developer options come unlocked, so if you want to flash CyanogenMod or something like that onto it you can. There also seems to be a problem with the screen. At rare times, if you press the power button to turn the screen on the screen won't respond, but the backlight will. The first time you encounter it you will probably be turning your phone on and off wondering what's the matter with it, but I find if you just use your thumbnail to snap the little opening on the bottom right of the phone, the screen will come on, back to normal. Despite that, the phone just works. Don't expect Samsung s7 quality of performance, but unless you're attempting to play a graphically intensive game you should be a-ok.Overall, this phone is nice. A pleasure to hold, and lasts about a good day under heavy load with bluetooth on. Comes with a lot of stuff, too. And the remote sensor on the phone, which isn't advertised directly, but is kind of Neoix's niche, works really well.Neoix plans to release a new phone in the coming months, one running Android 6.0, and with what I presume is a 2.5D screen. This phone may drop in price because of it, and if they can get it down to about $100 even or less, than this thing, hands down, beats any BLU or BLUBOO phone for that range. Wait for the price drop? I would say yes, or get the new Neoix phone once it releases (it should be around $200 itself). It's current price is fine however, and if you need a relatively cheap phone to call folks, and do basic phone things, this phone is definitely for you!",3.0

BLU Studio C 5+5 Smartphone with Lollipop OS- US GSM Unlocked - Black,BLU,59.99,4,"I wanted to get an unlocked phone for the freedom it affords and decided to get a Blu phone out of curiosity, wanting to try this brand for a long time already, so I bought this white Blu Studio C 5+5. As another customer stated, let us not confuse the word “cheap”; this device is certainly economical but by no means cheap.Because I already had an active account with them I activated the Studio C 5+5 with MetroPCS and after three full days of using it I can say that so far it is a very good phone and I am pretty much happy with it.Even as we remember that this is not a high-end phone -and the affordable price I paid for it is my witness!- I can say that it compares very favorably with other similar devices.Design-wise, it is a beautiful phone and it looks much more high-end than what it is. The speed will not impress anyone but, again, we are not paying $700 for it. Still, the speed is good. The volume is somewhat disappointing, especially when using the speaker on calls, but it sounds pretty loud when listening to music and with very good quality. The earphones, included along with a case and screen protector, are excellent.As far as battery life, the jury is still out. I will have to keep a closer eye on that regard but so far it may be the phone’s weakest point.Would I recommend this phone? I certainly would. Would I consider another Blu device when it comes time to upgrade? You bet. (I already have my sight set on the Vivo Air LTE and the Vivo 5).",0.0

Motorola Droid 2 Global Black No Contract Verizon Cell Phone - Condition,Motorola,119.99,5,"The Motorola Droid is arguably one of the best phone series in creation due to the physical qwerty kyeboard. My previous phone (which is a note 3) cease to function and I decided to buy a Droid 2 Global due to the physical keyboard. I've got to say, I'm thoroughly impressed with this phone for the price I paid. This phone supports both GSM/CDMA bandwidths so it's an ideal choice for someone if you're on a wireless carrier, but Verizon blocked GSM carriers. With a little bit of tweaking, you can get the Droid 2 Global to work on a US carrier, it requires an unlock code and radio band mod. As in regards to software wise, the phone can't compete with current phones due to specifications, but if you're a light smartphone user, this issue won't plague you. The only complaint I have is the battery life, the droid 2 global is notorious for having abysmal battery life. But I can't complain due to the price I purchased the Droid 2 Global. Overall, this phone is an aged device, but it's a excellent choice if you're browsing for a cheap phone.P.S. The seller Chubbie's Tech should be well praised, my package came to my house one day before the estimated shipping date by Amazon. The description on the condition of the phone was also completely accurate, like new condition. They also did an excellent job of packaging. Thanks again, Chubbie's Tech, you made my day.",2.0
"Samsung Galaxy S6 SM-G920i Factory Unlocked Cellphone, 32GB, Blue INTERNATIONAL VERSION NO WARRANTY",samsung,429.99,5,"I only owned the phone for a few days, and I like it very much so far. The screen is awesome, very bright and sharp. It makes great pictures, although I was surprised to find out that you do not need to unlock the phone to take pictures. I see possibility of pranks and unauthorized picture taking. The phone works so fast compared to my old not so smart smartphone, it is amazing how things are changing. The phone is lightweight, charges fast, and the battery last for quite long time. I signed up for MetroPCS, my main complaint is that I had to go the store to activate the phone. They would not accept the phone online (they only list ancient phones in their bring your own page, probably to discourage people from buying phones from other places). Do not buy sim card from the store - online and at Walmart it is $10, the MetroPCS guy wanted $25 for the card.Update: I got second S6 phone (White) for a family member, and activated it with Ting service, it was very easy, I needed to order a GSM SIM card from them, and it takes a few days to arrive. You activate the phone with the SIM card then, not with the phone itself. I am thinking about switching my own service to Ting, too.",4.0

I had LG-G2 earlier that worked very nice for almost 2 yrs. So I went ahead and bought this G4 phone. It could be only from this seller or all unlocked G4 phones or just G4 in general, but battery is worst. From first day of usage, battery used to drain out in less than 2 days without any data or wireless. I kept it at bare minimum to just test it out. As soon as I started wireless, battery started to drain out in less than a day and with LTE ON, it started to drain from 100% to 15% in just 4 hrs. I had to almost keep it in charge almost every hour of day at work just so my phone doesnt suddenly turn off.Today, June 1 (less than 9 months from purchase), phone suddenly turned off and wont start anymore.

After having an opportunity to truly evaluate and use it, I thought I'd weigh in with my review. For those looking for an alternative or an unlocked world phone, the Nokia E71 ""answers the call""! Okay, all joking aside, the E71 smartphone has a quality look and feel and is constructed well (made in Finland), lightweight, and user-friendly. The E71 runs the Symbian S60 OS, which provides familiarity to those who have owned a Nokia phone before. The E71 I purchased came with Nokia GPS for free as part of the Symbian S60 3rd edition. The pros to running the Symbian OS is that you can utilize a great deal of apps, both for sale and for free. Another app that comes to mind is Joikuspot, which turns the E71 into a wireless hotspot. Other pros are the speakers (both handset and loudspeaker), form factor, ease of use, switchable home screens (work or personal), keyboard layout, Wi-Fi, camera w/ flash, etc. This smartphone has taken my life organization to a whole new level with the very intuitive and easy to use calendar, seamless email, and messaging setup. There are also a great deal of accessories which can be had with this smartphone. Last but not least, the call quality is great with this E71 and I have experienced no issues with clarity, and only 1 dropped call since I've owned it (I suspect that it was due to low cell signal as I was on the edge of the tower at the time). Overall, I'm very pleased with this smartphone's features, ease of use, and build quality.",1.0

BLU Energy X 2 - With 4000 mAh Super Battery - Global GSM Unlocked Smartphone - Gold,BLU,109.99,3,"This is a very nice phone, but be aware that the screen is rather fragile. 3 days after getting this for my daughter she dropped it, and the screen completely shattered. She was really happy with the phone up to that point. It's fast, the battery life is great, and she preferred the size of it over her previous Motorola G. It's also very light for having such a sizeable battery in it. These Energy phones from BLU are really nice if you've got app hungry users that aren't always close to an outlet. I would definitely buy this phone again.As an FYI for DIY electronics geeks, there is a site for ordering parts for BLU phones, called bluphoneparts.com. From what I can tell they are not directly affiliated with BLU, and I caution against ordering from them as they are simply not responsive. The screen I bought from them lasted less than 30 days before just failing. I've tried contacting them several times and no one returns phone or email messages, so if you want to repair your own BLU phone, be careful working with these guys. BLU could do a better job of making their phones repairable, too. For the most part it was an easy replacement, but there were a few points where they used glues that were hard to work around.",1.0

So I got the phone from seller ""ProntoTech"" it was the (N9000)in a reasonable amount of time, came with, charger, earphones, 2 batteries, and a cover flip type not very good one but will do till other cover arrives also came with a screen protector already installed on it which was great I hate putting those things on !I have service thru consumer celluar which runs off the att network, I just put in my sim and BOOM! it read it and started up right away no problems well not many couldn't get pic msgs.& data plan to connect at first but thru some very simple settings to the APN it was all fixed right away, and I'm loving this phone! it is only 3g and runs a bit slower on data plan but wi fi is excellent runs fast on wifi and the 3g isn't that slow, maybe I'm lucky and just got a good one but I've had no problems with gps(works fine),or the headphones tried 5 different sets all but one worked fine, bluetooth works great also, to be honest I think this phone is great so far,and it didn't come pre loaded with a bunch of ""Bloteware"" that Samsung includes with there phones all that unesecary crap, one thing I do like is when you put it to ""sleep"" it turns off everything wi fi ect and all comes back on when you hit wake/power button saves the battery which by the way is great with min.- to med use lasts day & 1/2 with heavy use about 8-10 hrs so no issues there, front camera i'snt all that but who really uses the front camera that much? back camera is good not great but good enough, all in all its a great phone for the price ! and just a tip when your setting it up or making a call when first using and the screen goes blank or black just power off and take battery out reinsert and power up again and do a factory reset in settings you should actually do this any way b4 you get all your contacts ect. on phone and you shouldn't have any issues after that if you not phone savvy and not sure about APN settings ect. call your carrier and have them walk you thru it.

I entered random number to unlock the phone, it was not accepted and there is only 10 attempt to enter UNLOCK key.I called T mobile customer care and I felt that call was outsourced to Philippines.Their answer why they cannot help:Thank you for taking the time to contact T-Mobile. We have received your SIM Unlock Request. Unfortunately, we are unable to process your request at this time. The account must meet the following criteria:1. Subscriber has been active for 40 days since the device was first used on the line2. Must have $50.01 or more in accumulative refills since activation3. Must have device usage within the last 7 days by the mobile number requesting the unlock codePlease submit a new SIM Unlock Request once the subscriber has met the Eligibility criteria.I felt that customer care based in Philippines appears to be interested in finding the reason why they cannot help. It appears that they just read the script. They are good with FAQ.I think when it is pre paid phone and customer has paid full price of phone, it is right of customer to have unlock phone. If it is locked phone, customer care should be able to assist in unlocking the phone right away.I gave 2 star rating because it is LOCKED phone, not UNLOCK phone as stated when I bought it.",2.0

"Samsung Behold 2 II T939 Unlocked Android Phone with 5MP Camera, Touchscreen, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth - Unlocked Phone - US Warranty - Brown",Samsung,99.99,4,"First off - I bought this phone as a ""temporary"" replacement for an AT&T phone. I did some initial research, took the plunge and bought it. I went into this knowing that it is an unlocked T-Mobile phone being run on the AT&T network. As forewarned some features may not be supported. I have three issues that I can live with for the short term until I can get a decent contract phone (like the Motorola Atrix) without paying full retail.1st issue: Sending/Receiving embedded pics via text messaging does not work2nd issue: Does not recognize the AT&T 3G service (if someone out there does have it showing the AT&T 3G - please let me know).3rd issue: Processor is underpowered.More research and drudging through the Android forums - I found that someone else acknowledged the lack of supporting the AT&T 3G service. If you can update to Android 1.6 (I have not yet and won't till I have my contract replacement phone and will risk doing the update then), that seems to improve performance - at least in some of the reviews I have read. Unless you are running this over a T-Mobile network - you will not be able to do an over-the-air update. The 1.6 update is available at: [...] There seems to be two updates you have to apply. Once I do this (probably in a few months - I will update here).I do like the phone. It is nicely sized, has a good feature-set. The camera and video quality is pretty decent with a good set of controls. The call quality is excellent as is playing music out of it. I do use it as an alarm clock - though be forwarned. For some reason - the alarm clock version that comes with the phone does not allow you to add music from your mp3 collection to wake up to. But the Timer app does. Go figure.BATTERY ISSUE1 other issue that I am NOT down rating the phone for. I bought this phone back at the beginning of June. Battery life was as advertised - but this week has rapidly declined in performance daily. Today as example - started off the day with a fully charged phone - only sent/received 3 text messages. I am assuming this is a product that sat on the shelf for a long period of time. It is under warranty with the seller (BluetekUSA). I have sent this issue to them and am hoping to resolve this shortly.Hope this helps. Good phone. If you are buying to run on the T-Mobile network - by all means go for it. If you are a novice user and don't want to mess with updates - see if your reseller in this marketplace will do the 1.6 update for you. Doesn't hurt to ask!Robert",14.0

(MODEL#: S240 LIGHT BLUE)",Posh Mobile,49.99,5,"I decided two years ago to never again pay more than $100 for a phone, as I believe it is better to put my money into a good tablet or laptop. I don't use my phone for games, and only put on it the most essential apps, since these ""free"" games and apps have access to all your contacts, phone logs, email, and location. I have plenty of other tablets and laptops to play games on whenever I want. I use my phone for calls, texts, and occasionally email.I love the Windows phones, but they appear to be dying, so I looked for my next replacement. I couldn't decide on this or the Blu Amazon phone, so I got both. My plan was to use the Posh for my audio books (which I listen to constantly), and the other one as my phone. I bought this more as a joke than a serious phone, and at $30, why not? The small size seemed ideal for me, as I spend a lot of time walking my two Golden Lab pups through the woods, and I have too much gear packed into my Scottevest already.I opened up both phones, set up the Blu, which is bigger than any other phone I have been using, and seemed very limited. I was not at all impressed.Then I set up the Posh, and fell in LOVE with it. It doesn't have a ton of memory, but has plenty for what I need it for. It even fits perfectly in the license ID holder in my vest, and weighs next to nothing. I decided to use this as my phone instead.The only hard part was the one time log in to my essential accounts, the keyboard is tiny. I can't imagine typing text messages on it, but it works just fine using the microphone. For most things you can use the microphone instead of the keyboard. Which I'm sure is why they call it a ""Micro"" phone.Just as I got it all set up, I dropped it on concrete. Yup, shattered the screen. It is still usable, but I decided to replace it because I like it that much.I logged in to buy another one, only to find the price had gone up to $50. It seems other people also liked this phone, and demand had driven the price up.If it ever comes back to $30, I'm buying a case of them. They would make great gifts. And I'm sure I will drop it again, as I am a klutz.But even at $50, it is a great deal.",1.0

Posh Mobile Orion S450 Android Smartphone Unlocked GSM Worldwide Dual SIM - Black,Posh Mobile,114.99,4,After some confusion in tracking the delivery - the phone did arrive within the dates the seller promised. The phone itself is a nice piece of machinery. It comes in a nice package - better than some of the A list manufacturers. And - the phone comes with a screen protector and a bumper case. Pretty nice. Fairly basic in its offerings - but it has Google Play Store - so adding apps is not a problem.This phone is for my mother in law and it seemed like a nice step up from her flip phone.Two issues with the phone. The texting app is not good. It does not pull area codes from the contact list - so texts will not go through. However - downloading another texting app took care of that.Additionally - the set up with ATT was not as simple as just loading the SIM card. After some frustration - I found (with the help of an ATT customer service rep) the instructions on ATT and Posh for changing the APN. That is key if you want to take advantage of your data plan and access the web.A little more set up than I wanted - but the phone appears to be working well.,21.0

BLU LIFE ONE X2 - 4G LTE Unlocked Smartphone - 64GB+4GB RAM - Grey,,199.99,5,"Easily the best $200 unlocked phone on the market. I usually don't leave product reviews, but honestly felt the need to for this phone when I saw some of the critical ones on here. Three stars for not having the latest and greatest wifi standard? Same for Blu mixing metal with plastic on the back cover? Please...For reference, I use the OnePlus 3 as my daily driver, and intend the Blu Life One X2 to be a backup or travel phone. I'm also considering ditching the OP3 for the BLU, not because the BLU is better (it's not - the OP3 is a beast), but because, as cool as USB-C is, I've recently found myself out and about and needing a quick battery charge and NO ONE has a spare USB-C charger lying around, whereas you can find a micro USB charger literally everywhere. Your grandma probably has one in her kitchen drawer and doesn't even know it... So that alone is actually a plus to me (and since it uses Qualcomm's quick charge 3.0 standard, it charges incredibly fast!)Beyond that, everything has just ""worked"" for me. Maybe I'm lucky, but some of these reviews stating malware is installed seem bogus. I've owned a couple other BLU phones in the past and that's never occurred, and after running three different virus, trojan and malware scans on this one I can confirm there's nothing there. Perhaps those other reviewers should more carefully scrutinize the apps they're downloading...Other than that, the phone performs like a midrange device should, has plenty of memory and storage space, and battery life is solid.Screen is super clear but a little washed out (it's definitely no AMOLED), but I'm used to it after 3 days.All in all it's an amazing phone for the price, and I don't think you'll regret it.",11.0

HTC DROID INCREDIBLE ADR 6300 3G Android Phone Black (Verizon Wireless),HTC,29.99,3,"I have had the Droid Incredible for a little over a year at the time of this review. I believe that I have a good ""feel"" for this phone now that I've used it for a while, and my summary is that I don't think it deserves the title ""Incredible"". To clarify my review, I am reviewing both the phone and the operating system (Android 2.3.4 on my device). I think reviewing the operating system is applicable because HTC has its own custom flavor of Android installed (HTC Sense) and that plays a part in how the phone functions (or not). I'm also using it on a prepaid carrier. Here's my breakdown:The good:1. It's a smartphone that runs Android which has a lot of free apps versus the competition.2. Voice quality is good, I've never had a problem with this. It's a phone after all!3. It records HD video.4. This is a smaller Android phone than others so it is more portable. It fits in my pocket nicely.5. Standby battery life is good if you turn everything off like data, wi-fi, etc.6. I like using my phone as a navigation device, and this phone has standalone GPS which is great. No need to have a cell signal/data connection if you use offline maps.7. 3.5mm headphone jack.8. Flashlight (I use it more than you think).The bad:1. Freezes WAY too often. This is my main issue with the phone, and I would give it another star if this freeze issue didn't exist. Freezing once in a while and having a reboot solve the problem is one thing. I'm talking about the phone freezing and then having to reboot several times before the phone decides to work again. I'm at the point where I'm afraid of turning the phone off because I will have to reboot several times until it decides to stop freezing. Trust me when I say I have done hours of research on how to fix this, and tried all sorts of tricks, with no success.2. Battery life drains quickly if you have connections like 3G enabled or watch video. My opinion about battery life is that you should be able to leave your data connection on all day and not run out of battery. This is actually rather common with a lot of older Android phones so I can't fault the HTC Incredible too much, I just live with it. My main gripe is that my ""smart"" phone is a dumb phone when I have to keep data and other services turned off most of the time so I can get through the day without recharging. I can't use features like voice search or voice text or push email without having to turn the data connection back on (because I'm conserving battery again). The push email works if you ""manage"" your battery, meaning you have an app turn on your connection every so often.3. Has too little phone memory and application data storage compared to how much storage there is on an SD card. What I mean is that I am using a 32gb SD card, with 25gb of free space left. I still have over 6gb of internal storage because I install all my apps on the SD card. However, I only have 99mb of phone memory left and 33mb of application data storage left. What this means is that I get a ""low space"" notification and can't install new apps or even update some of the larger apps on my phone (which by the way are all on the SD card) without uninstalling something. Again I have done tricks like deleting all my texts, killing apps, clearing the cache etc which frees up space but it still doesn't solve my ""low space"" problem.CONCLUSION: Overall, this is not a bad phone, but the ""deal killer"" for me is that the phone freezes a lot. I can adjust to things like low space or short battery life, but a phone that freezes even in the middle of a phone call is not good. I want to like this phone, and kind of do, but HTC could have done better with a phone named ""Incredible"".",2.0

I was pretty excited about that and ordered the largest SD card it could support with the phone. I stream most of my media content, so I don't store a lot of videos or music on my phone and majority of the storage was for apps.

"Nokia C6 Unlocked GSM Phone with Easy E-mail Setup, Side-Sliding Touchscreen, QWERTY, 5 MP Camera, and Free Ovi Maps Navigation (Black)",Nokia,59.95,3,"I purchased this unlocked phone, because I had been disappointed with a replacement sent to me by At&t. The phone seemed to have the features I was after, and it did. I liked it for the most part. After only a few weeks the coating on the 3 external buttons began peeling off. This is no big deal, as it doesn't at all effect the usability of the phone, just looks bad. After four months of use, the screen and buttons both began not working. The phone is under warranty and has been sent back for a repair/replacement. The company seemed to be easy to work with so far, but we will see. It seemed like four months was not long to last, so I fear that the replacement will probably only last till around the end of the warranty period. For the money spent I expected a phone that would last a couple years if taken care of, and it was taken care of. It had never been dropped,or gotten wet, and had a good screen protector installed on the day it arrived to me. I will update this review as I get the replacement and see how it holds up.Update:Well the service was fine. Got the phone back in a reasonable amount of time, and it had been repaired. It seemed fine and worked for another few months. Again it stopped working, still under warranty so I sent it off again. The company again has been good in that it has sent me a new phone. I just feel like there is no way the phone will last past the end of the warranty. I still like the phone, but the quality is obviously not there.",1.0

It came with a new set of genuine Apple earphones with remote and mic, dock connector to USB cable and USB power adapter. Touchscreen and battery seemed to be newly replaced as well!Googled around, selected a company on the internet that claimed to be the No. 1 iPhone unlock service provider; after payment to them, received from them a message claiming that ""software was being developed and would be available soon (without a commitment date when software will be available)"". Since then, I've never been able to get my money back through PayPal!Fortunately, there's a professional independent iPhone repair shop in town (not at&t, T-Mobile or Cincinnati Bell) who could help activate, jailbreak and unlock my phone; the phone works great now! I don't have to purchase a 2-year plan, I can use the best-deal package plan I want from either at&t, T-Mobile or Cincinnati Bell any time.

I was so used to Google's set up (and really liked it) that having something completely new invented was just a waste of company's money, I think. Since I didn't even take it out for a test drive, I cannot comment on the performance of the phone. It has new USB port and it is a bit large if you are used to 5"" or 4.8"" phone models.

"Blackberry Curve 8520 Unlocked Quad-Band GSM Phone with 2MP Camera, QWERTY Keyboard, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth - US Warranty - Opal Pink",BlackBerry,51.95,5,"the 8520 phone actually works well on at&t! no matter how much you learn the iphone keyboard, a blackberry full physical qwerty still wins, hands down. the spell checker and predictive type on bberry is better vs iphone and with the physical keyboard you misspell a lot less. since you can sync your itunes on here you only ""miss"" the iphone for its apps which really only work best on wifi. 8520 is lightweight, fairly thin, very light, has nicely spaced keys, and really cool media controls blended into the top of the device. nice use of rubber here on the device too lends some durability to glossy plastic finish. I jammed a 16G nand flash card into it too so i have music, movies etc with me. I bought the unlocked version since i use the 8520 when traveling to US from abroad .... without a full blackberry data package you lose out on things like email and blackberry messenger - but this is my 2nd/travel phone so i dont care too much - I use it when in the US with pay as you go on at&t - i get what i want a phone that works, easy texting, wifi browsing and music/video. iPhone is my main phone abroad but it wont stay that way once renewal time comes. I could easily see 8520 being my main phone but if you want the mobile internet experience (3G) and slightly cooler packaging then go for the 9700, but you pay for it - a lot more. given cost differential I would easily buy 8520 over 8900 ...8520 just feels a tad cooler too vs 8900 still too corporate. yet both are pretty similarly equipped. if you had full blackberry data package with this as your main phone u r probably happy person. i am more than happy with this as 2nd/travel phone. Cool thing about this unlocked version is i can buy pay as you go sim card, slip it in and work no matter where i am. in past my edge (non3G) blackberries actually run things like google apps and internet fairly well. i am sure 9700 with full 3G is better but necessary??",60.0

"Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge G925F 64GB Unlocked GSM LTE Octa-Core Smartphone - White Pearl (International version, No Warranty)",Samsung,469.99,2,"Few comments so as not to duplicate too many other reviews.The Pros: The phone itself has some amazing features and the display is beautiful. Incredibly thin and light. The array of sensors to include a pulse ox to signal strength to noise meter functions are both fun and useful. Photos are amazingly clear and beat any other phone I have ever used. My previous iPhone is like a model T compared to this one. This is a polished, beautiful device.The Cons are that my phone was not smooth on some game animations (Osmos) and generally didn't feel as crisp as my Moto X Pure and even my Nexus 5X. What was most troubling however was the signal strength I consistently got. I never get the phone to display that it was receiving LTE (my wife's iphone does in the same place) despite multiple attempts to configure it with AT&T. Wifi reception also was low--usually 2-3 bars or less when my other phones would read 4 bars. This vendor apparently got these phones overseas and quite frankly my phone just didn't seem to work consistently or at least optimally with ATT in the US. The power adapter that came with my unit is internationally configured, so you must use a bulky, nasty looking adapter to make the power adapter work with US plugs. Not a huge deal, but definitely an issue when traveling. The glass back looks beautiful when clean, but its a fingerprint magnet.8/20/16 Update: Its clear that this phone will not be updated to Marshmallow. ATT doesnt recognize the model and there is nothing from Samsung that provides a way to update. The baseband version seems like its completely unsupported, even by those root hackers out there. Its a dinosaur.The upshot for me is that I will be sending the phone back and either re-order to see if I just got a clunker, or I will pay another $200 and buy it directly from AT&T. I think this is a great phone, but not so sure I got a version/model/device that works well here in the US.",1.0

Less than 25 dollars for this phone!Secondly, I like Net10, because you can switch their calling plans hassle-free! I can easily tailor my daughter's plan to her actual cell phone usage!Add a cute ""blinged-out"" phone case Samsung R355c Blue Circle Silver Jewel Bling Dazzle Diamonds Protector Straight Talk Net 10 HardCase Cover Skin NET 10 Straight Talk and a phone charm, and she is in business!Did I mention the insane price, and that the phone arrived BRAND NEW, unopened, still in the box?It doesn't support Opera, but I was able to bookmark Google Mobile, which automatically gives her Google Maps (of course, she isn't going to need that yet, but it's nice to have, LOL).The phone also has a surprisingly decent mp3 player (you can upload music to it using a data cable), camera (no video, but your pics can be customized!), expandable memory and a standard 3.5mm headphone jack! You cannot watch YouTube videos, but you can use your mp3's for ringtones, something that too many contract (read: expensive) phones still won't allow you to do! The calls themselves come in clear. So far, we've had no problems with reception (everything works where we live, so we're probably not going to have too many issues with dropped calls).Best of all, my daughter LOVES her new phone.Thank you SO MUCH for providing this item for Amazon customers at such a great price!**UPDATE**Just a little tip....it costs 3.5 minutes to send an MMS, so if possible, link your device via Bluetooth and send MMS that way.",26.0

Motorola Moto E (1st Generation) - Black - 4 GB - US GSM Unlocked Phone,Motorola,89.99,5,"I bought one of these for myself to try out as a upgrade from an ATT Hawie GoPhone. I have to say that I am very pleased with my decision.Pros: Nice resolution on the screen, almost completely stock Android operating system, 32gig micro SD slot (you will want to put one in), not the fastest processor but definately fast enough (no noticeable lag in any application so far although a gammer might challenge it). Can use them outside the use with any compatible sim card.Cons: No front facing camera, no flash but for $130 it is not a show stopper. We use an iPad for FaceTime anyway and don't do selfies.I bought a second one for my wife and she is thrilled. The screen is big enough and clear enough to read from and it sync's with Amazon Kindle so she can use it on the go. The phone audio quality is good and the signal strength seems strong. It also works flawlessly with Google (you would expect that being a Google company).We use this on Consumer Cellular (which runs on ATT's network) and it works great. Cost wise you can't beat this deal....$130 for the phone from Amazon x2 and $37/month for 200 shared mins and 100mb's of shared data. That is enough for us since we run wifi most of the time, especially if we are streaming any significant content. CS lets you up your plan if you get close on usage and they notify you if you do. For $5 more we can get 500 shared mins anytime. No contract.So $260 for two really nice and capable smart phones with a $37/month total for both....Can't beat this deal. At least I can't find a way too!",3.0
Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mineral Black (US Warranty),Sony,649.99,5,"I've had this phone for a number of weeks now and am very pleased overall.When I was looking to buy a new phone I was comparing this one specifically to Google's Pixel. Some of my initial concerns were getting updates timely, durability, and price.The hardware is standard for 2016 phones. The Pixel has a slightly newer processor that's negligibly faster. It was a disappointment the XZ only had 3GB of RAM though. This was still an upgrade from my previous phone however. There's also 1 very important fact to keep in mind when buying the latest and greatest in processing power - battery life. The Pixel had a beefier (ever so slightly) processor, and yet a smaller battery. Battery life will take a hit because of that. I was much less worried about it with this phone. The XZ (in the US) doesn't have a fingerprint sensor which is a bummer but I'm not going to miss it. The camera IS as high quality as Sony claims. I love it and can get off 10+ pictures without slow down.One of the reasons I was looking into the Pixel was because it would be nice to have a pure android phone. Samsung phones have that god-awful TouchWiz business and Sony's have the Xperia UI. You also have to wait for updates. I'm currently still waiting for Android 7.0 which I'm getting impatient for. The one thing I like about the Xperia is the customizability. Everyone Oo's and Awe's when they see my phone because the menus, buttons, etc all look extremely different from a normal android and they're surprised to find out I haven't rooted it.Some features this phone has that I couldn't get with Google's.Waterproofing - This was HUGE for me. I don't go around getting my phones wet however I have dropped one in the toilet before. That slip-up will destroy non-waterproof phonesSD card slot - If the phone has 64GB of internal memory or more it's not an issue. Unfortunately to get that with the Pixel it massively hiked the price. Beyond what this phone cost.Front facing speakers - This was also a big deal for me. I listen to music quietly in the mornings when getting ready and can't wear headphones while doing it. I hate the way sound comes out muffled when the speakers are pointed somewhere else.In the end I decided I could live with the Xperia interface, one gig less of RAM and slow updates. I like the way this phone looks. It's unique. Sony goes the opposite direction of simply copying Apple like Google did with the Pixel. Anything hardware-wise the Pixel had over the XZ, this phone beat with additional features (like the waterproofing). I feel like for the money I'd rather buy those features than a sliver of improvement in hardware.",12.0

"HTC Touch Dual P5520 Unlocked Slider SmartPhone with Windows Mobile 6.0, 2 MP Camera, International 3G, MP3/Video Player, MicroSD Slot--International Version No Warranty",HTC,27.88,3,"I got this phone because I broke my previous one and still had 1 year left on contract with ATT. I wanted a smart phone that would not affect my contract with my carrier and that didn't require a third mortgage to buy. This phone fit the bill. The touch screen works well enough but the Windows Mobile operating system that it comes with just feels very unpolished compared to the iPhone. And you will definitely need the stylus that it comes with for the very finger unfriendly touch functions. It's convenient that the stylus stores invisibly on board the phone and is available at a simple thumbnail flick. The mechanism that holds the stylus in place works well, I have no trouble accessing it when needed and I have no fear of it falling out when stored. The battery cover on the other hand is constantly coming off. It engages in the same direction as the slider so you will often find yourself attempting to slide open the phone one handed and instead you will slide off the battery cover from underneath and will have to fumble to not drop the phone. Dropping it from a height of 2 ft or more onto carpet instantly pops off the cover and dumps the unsecured battery forcing a hard reboot. The 20 button manual keyboard is nice when you don't want to use the stylus to dial a number but I find myself not really wanting to use the slide feature for fear of the cover issue. The mini usb port that is used for both data connection and charging is hidden underneath a rubber flap which I was sure would eventually break off or refuse to seal back in place but it has worked surprisingly well. The phone is already antiquated technology with no wi-fi or accelerometers which are now common place on smartphones and realistically although they are not really important features for a phone you will miss them if you are used to having them. But if they are not $300 important the price of this phone more than makes up for the loss of those capabilities.The best thing about Windows mobile is that you can very often find free software to fix any of the issues you might have with the software, or you can make your own if you have the capability. There is no central big brother controlled 'app store' to purchase from or to approve apps. The downside of this however is that it is not as easy to find the apps you want and you have to be savvy enough to locate them on your own, but there are plenty of ""top 10 windows apps"" type websites that will help you locate the common most used software with a simple BING search.So in summary the price of the phone and the fact that it is unlocked and able to be used with just about any carrier is really it's biggest attribute, It functions well for my main purposes but more hardcore users will probably find it lacking. If you want an iPhone or a Droid and you can afford one then get it, they are superior products. On the other hand if you just want a functional smart phone and want to ease into touch screen without losing the capability of a hard keyboard. This phone wont set you back too much.",3.0

However, I realized that it's not as what's hyped up to be. The memory didn't come with the phone so I had to go out and buy one separately last night and then the map features doesn't even load but prompts many questions over and over again then it crashes. Furthermore, I had to open the battery case then disconnect in order for the phone to work again! The GPS doesn't work either since I have the old AT&T service and I don't have the data plan. I thought the GPS was a feature like you get from buying GPS separately in which it doesn't require internet service but satellite only. The short-cut email feature doesn't work either! I tried many ways to get it right but it keeps prompting me with same messages over and over again. So I had to log on to the web site feature then log into Yahoo then get my email that way, so what's the short-cut feature for if it doesn't work? Also, I had a difficult time to find where to delete the email account once you created one??!! The number buttons are really small so when you just want to dial a number you really have to look for the right button to push. All other features and icons are really small as well and too many to really understand which one is which. I guess I'm used to having iPhone's bigger icons and user friendliness and now this Nokia is a big disappointment. I wouldn't be complaining too much if this E71 hadn't been over $300 dollars. If it were only around $200 then I would give it an average rating instead of only one star. For $300 you can do much better. In fact, iPhone is only couple hundred more and worth it. I just didn't like the battery life on iPhone so I gave this E71 a try. Before I close, I should mention that the camera/flash seems to work fine and the battery life on E71 seems to be awesome and long lasting once you fully charge it. I may just get the cheaper version of the Nokia since I can't use email, map and GPS features from this phone. So beware of these complaints before you order this phone for $300.Edit:Someone responded to my review by saying that since I didn't have a data plan I couldn't download maps and emails. That's true but I was logged on with Wi-Fi and it still didn't work, whereas with iPhone I didn't have any of those issues.",7.0

Nokia Lumia 928 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows Smartphone w/ 8MP Carl Zeiss Optics Camera - Black,Nokia,138.4,3,"After 6 months of daily usage, I believe I have a relatively complete picture of what I got, and hence would like to provide some opinion to whoever are interested.Pros:- solid build quality. It did fall on the hardwood/concrete floor a couple of times, and no damage or dent was left on the phone.- good picture quality. Although the software (Windows Phone 8.1) sometimes refuse to switch the scene modes, the picture quality is pretty good at various light conditions.- nice display. What you can expect from a AMOLED -- vivid color, good resolution, dark ""dark"".- I confirm the phone work well with any local wireless network (home network, company network, even hotspots from other cellphones). The phone also works with 4G cellular signals. I am not sure whether it is LTE, but I can watch youtube video without freezing.Cons:- I am using this phone with T-mobile. I confirm I can NOT send any text messages. I can receive text messages, though. It is still annoying.- sometimes when the T-mobile signal is not 4G (the cellphone shows ""H"" which I believe means HSPA/3G), I cannot connect to internet from my cellphone.- Battery life is relatively short. Even I don't use it much for browsing internet signal, it could run out of juice at the end of the day.All in all, if you don't travel a lot and always have good local wireless connection, this phone is worth the price. If you do travel, it feels awkward when you cannot use the cellular signal to connect to the internet, especially when you need it.",0.0

"BLU Studio 5.0 HD Unlocked Cellphone, White",BLU,119.99,2,"I really wanted to love this phone, but unfortunately I ended up having to return it.I have been a T-Mobile customer for 2 years. I previously had a Samsung Galaxy S2, which I also used as a home hotspot and never had a problem getting a 4G signal at my house. Right off the bat, except in brief moments, this phone stayed on the 2G/Edge network constantly. I contacted T-Mobile support, and they said a) this is not a T-Mobile supported device and b) the specs of the phone show that its 4G LTE frequencies are 1700/2600, and T-Mobile uses 1700/2100. You have to have both frequencies working for the upload and download. Here is the official T-Mobile document explaining that: https://support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-4988I had seen some mention of T-Mobile updating some of their network and being able to get 3G/HSPA+ on the 1900 frequency, but that depends on your area. When I asked support why the phone wasn't accessing that, they had no answer. They just said that a non-supported device is never going to show anything other than Edge. So be aware that if you end up having network issues, you might have problems getting any help from T-Mobile.Other notes:It functioned a lot like my Samsung Galaxy S2, which was OK for me but might not be OK for people who need something faster. I did love the display quality, and I thought the speakers were pretty loud. I noticed that the speaker made a popping noise when I got notifications and I didn't even have the volume up all the way.The built in FM radio was pretty sweet - sounded great on headphones.I did NOT like the Android KitKat platform. I realize this is not uniquely a BLU phone issue (it would be the same with any phone running KitKat), but it was aggravating to not be able to have my Gmail and Google Hangouts messages syncing properly over my Wifi connection at home. I was getting notifications HOURS late. Apparently this is just a KitKat bug that is hard to fix (I never did find a solution that worked). I didn't see any official announcements of an update for this phone. BLU will be updating some other models later in the year, but I didn't see any mention of this model. I think there are some folks out there who have figured out how to root the phone to install Lollipop, but I didn't bother.I also didn't like the quality of the camera. The S2 had an 8MP camera and I thought the 13MP would be a major improvement, but the pictures were really grainy. The front facing camera was also weird - it seemed to make everything elongated and distorted.I noticed several reviews talking about how flimsy the back is and how it could be easily broken. In all fairness, it was pretty much the same as the Galaxy S2 and some other Samsung phones I have seen, but that is indeed pretty thin and you do have to be careful with the snaps. The case that came with the phone was a nice extra, but it was by no means something that would offer a lot of protection if the phone were dropped.Like many other customers, I also had GPS issues. Google Maps showed my location as being about 4 miles from my actual location every time I tried to use it.Overall, I was very disappointed. I didn't expect this phone to function like a new $600 phone, but none of the main selling points (4G LTE, 13MP camera, KitKat OS) worked properly. I had no choice but to return it so I could get a phone that actually makes use of my calling plan.",6.0

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,5,"This is a really good phone in today's mid range of Android phones.The phone is excellent and performs really well. It came with Gingerbread 2.3.4 already installed, that means, better performance compared to 2.2.x (Quadrant benchmarks this phone over the Samsung Galaxy S, which has a 1GHz CPU), better battery life and improves the video shooting quality to full VGA resolution.The phone battery stands for more than one full day with almost everything on (full brightness, GPS, Wifi, and BT), and lots of calls and sms per day, however,the 2G/3G data connection is off as I have Wifi connection in the office all day and I'm not using the mobile data connection in transit to/from home, where I also have wifi connection.Nevertheless, I tested the 3G connection with Movistar network in Venezuela and it works very well.The screen is bright and sharp. It does have some reduced visibility in direct sun light but it is way better than older touch screens I've used.The multi-touch works great. It is really sensible and the screen size is enough to type comfortable in landscape mode and almost comfortable in portrait mode.The only thing I haven't tried so far is the GPS and navigation functionality.The phone arrived without the 2GB microSD Card, but can't go against the phone and score it with 5 stars.

"ASUS ZenFone 2 Laser Unlocked Smartphone, 3GB RAM, 32GB Storage",ASUS Computers,229.0,5,"UPDATE (12/23/2015):Thank you, Thew, Picasso, and Sean for your very helpful comments. I was overly harsh with my initial rating because I was quite upset with Asus at the time for calling their phone ""Cricket compatible"" when Cricket said it was not. I did not know that the Cricket IMEI checker, and online IMEI checkers in general, are so unreliable. Interestingly, I also called ASUS support after posting my initial review, and after giving them the serial number and IMEI, they themselves told me that they were very sorry, but this device is most definitely not compatible with the Cricket network (even though on the ASUS website they say that it is compatible).But based on your comments, I went ahead with the activation anyway, without any problems, and the phone appears to be working perfectly. It's actually a nice device. To my ears the call quality is very good, and I'm also quite satisfied with the photo quality. Plus, I really like having a phone with a replaceable battery.My original rating was one star for the ASUS company, but I'm updating it to five stars for the ASUS Zenfone 2 Laser device.If I encounter any issues with the phone itself, I will report them here.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I purchased this phone, intending to use it on the Cricket network. In various places on the ASUS website, it says that this model (Zenfone 2 Laser, ZE551KL) is compatible with Cricket. However, Cricket insists that it is NOT COMPATIBLE. I tried their online check where you enter the IMEI number, and I also called Cricket directly. The answer is the same, that this device is not compatible.I'm not too knowledgeable about the technicalities of cell phones and network compatibility, and I guess it is possible that it will still work on the Cricket network, even though they say it is not officially compatible. Not sure if I'll try it anyway or just return it. What a waste of my time!I really blame ASUS for this. How can they say this phone is compatible with Cricket when Cricket has not even validated this model for use with their network. That's what we call ""false advertising"".",6.0

Apple iPhone 4S 32GB (Black) Unlocked - Verizon,Apple,199.0,5,"I just love my iPhone 4S that I use with Tracfone! iPhone came in excellent condition and looked brand new. There was extra time involved with Tracfone but well worth the time to be able to use an iPhone. One suggestion with dealing with Tracfone, if the first Tracfone person you talk to isn't able to help you definitely call back again to get another Tracfone person. First time I called Tracfone the guy, who sounded intelligent but wasn't, told me I couldn't use the phone with Tracfone something to do with Verizon. I called Verizon (Verizon also checked out the phone serial number and said it wasn't stolen) and to call Tracfone back. I was glad I called Tracfone back. Tracfone person I got knew her job, was intelligent, very nice, and very helpful! She spent time on the phone putting in information, getting any problems straightened out, and was nice the whole time. I was willing to put time in with the call and was never at any time impatient. I was told that I'd lose my minutes from my old Tracfone. She was able to get around that. She put in just a few minutes and told me to call back in a few days to get the rest of the minutes if the minutes didn't automatically show up on the iPhone. I called back and yes it did take time but I got all my minutes from my old Tracfone! I live where there is hills and trees and get good reception with the iPhone 4S. Was all the time spent on the phone with Tracfone worth it? YES!! I now have an iPhone and service that doesn't cost and arm and a leg!! Just remember when calling Tracfone if you get someone that doesn't help you or is rude, definitely call back. Tracfone does have excellent personal that actually do know their job and are very nice. So far the phone is working perfectly.",

I tried to connect Outlook to my work account. Corporate e-mail connections require Android to use a 6 digit PIN. The BLU phone asked me to enter a 6 digit PIN then confirm it. The next time the lock screen came up it asked for a 4 digit PIN and then proceed to count down ""You have x tries left"" each time got to the fourth digit of the full 6 PIN.I went thru the process several times having to wipe the unit and start over each time. Finally I worked around the issue by logging on with a alpha numeric code instead.The BLU VIVO5 has a customized lock screen, so I called up there tech support. This was clearly a software bug but they insisted on going thru a script to wipe my phone and start over. I asked for a supervisor and calmly and clearly explained the situation to me. In spite of *UNDERSTANDING* that this was a software bug, he two insisted that I go thru the process of flattening the phone, and sending me a replacement.Besides being completely useless, it had no hope of solving the problem, and he refused to take a bug report to the software escalation team, or verify the problem himself.This is just a bad, bad customer experience and a terrible policy for the company.

Moto G Play (4th gen.) - White - 16 GB - Unlocked,,149.0,5,"Was n market for replacement for my HTC ONE M 8 which needs new battery and charging port after 2 years of service. First off very seldom use yhe camera on any phone ever. Maybe just me but if I want a picture I'll bring my Nikon not any phone period can take a picture that I want to save and enlarge . That said I already like this phone for ease of use and fast access. Comes with minimal apps. And charge lasts forever I mean using auto display and if you set it to not search for wi fi may battery is lasting over 36 hours . Now that's not using it much for www and I plug it into usb port on car stereo instead of Bluetooth but do that with all my phones. That's why I bought this phone I bought Moto X for wife and shes had it 2 years and still holds charge great and never a hiccup.Geez peeps read the ad it clearly defined that it has ads. And really that's a prob, you most likely found this phone from a Prime redirect anyway. Quit bitchin and complaining and go buy iPhone for 5 or 6 X's as much.

BLU Life 8 XL Smartphone - Unlocked - Global GSM - White,BLU,125.99,4,"Initial report after only a few days; it's ok for the low price, don't spend more than $100 for it.First the negatives; 1. when you dial on the dial pad, there is slight pausing if you dial real fast, you don't have to press each number more than once though, it still catches up with the dialing. I thought this is rather odd for a phone with an Octacore processor, considering my old phones don't pause when dialing the numbers, they can keep up. Perhaps a software update could fix it? I tried adding different dialers, it did not help, it is a slight delay but it doesn't really affect the function of the phone. 2. Big chin on bottom of phone with no buttons=wasted space and makes it bigger than it should be (which you can already see that and it's in other reviews so I knew that before buying it). 3. Notification volume is paired with ringer volume, you cannot adjust the volume of notification separately. I tried downloading various volume apps it did not work, still the same. 4. Still no Lollipop Update! This is Feb. 20th 2016 and still no Lollipop update! It was supposed to be released back in August 2015! I actually don't like Lollipop, so that is alright with me :), but I would download it if it was avilable, I would back up my phone first, and then update it to Lollipop.Good things:Reception is good (although it show less bars, I looked in settings/about/sim where it shows the reception and it is strong), in other words Blu fixed the fact that their phones were showing a stronger signal than they really had IMHO, now it is more accurate.Ringtone/external speaker is loud enough so far (I have not tried speakerphone yet), I was listening to youtube and it is loud enough.Voice talking sounds good; I made a call to another phone and left a voicemail and it was very clear, sounded really natural I was surprised.Fast processor! It can run games pretty good, so far I have been playing a few games like temple run, bejeweled and it rain them fine.Nice screen, pretty good.Battery life is good; having screen on for any reason will cause it to drain (like any phone with a big screen), when not in use and in standby battery doesn't use anything even after a long time.Sound recorder works fine (voice notes)Nice package; came with a matching yellow rubber/silicon case, white charger, headphones, manual, screen protectorOther: I run ZenUi Launcher which is pretty sweet :)Be careful using sim card adaptor, when removing your sim the contacts can get damaged if it is not smooth and flush when removing the card. Also, push into the little hole provided there to push the sim card out, instead of pulling and less likely for sim adapter to damage the sim pins.Considering it has 2 sim clots, this is an awesome value for $100. If you do not care about having 2 sim slots, you can get other nice phones used and even new for around $100 which makes it a tougher decision. Really though, for $100 you just can't go wrong here.

"HTC T8788 7 Surround Unlocked Phone with Windows 7, Surround Sound, 5MP Camera and HD Video - US Warranty - Black",HTC,84.99,5,"All in all the HTC Surround is a great handset.I purchased the device for use with the Straight Talk Sim Card program. It works very well excluding the ability to send mms which is a issue which is universal to WP7 devices.On to the device.THE GOOD:Screen - The device has a very bright screen that is of decent quality. Its not an AMOLED but its close.Cellular Modem - I looked this up as best as I could before hand to see if this was an HSPA+ device. It does appear to be an HSPA+ device. I have speedtested it at well over 4+mbps on straight talks att mvno network.Physical Dimensions - The phone is a good size and heft. It feels like a sturdy device and the back covers matte finish gives it a sophisticated feel.Speaker - Other reviewers have listed this as not all too impressive, I would disagree here. I think the speaker adds a lot to the device and is miles betters than a standalone smartphone speaker. It outputs a full rich sound. Is it a reason to buy the phone, well , no not really but its a nice bonus.Performance - Like every other windows device the surround has a smooth user experience with no hickups or bugs. Netflix streaming was smooth and high quality. Apps functioned very well with no noticeable issues.THE BAD:Updates - As this is an older handset it required over 8 updates to be installed prior to being functional. This process took well over 2.5 hours.Kick Stand - The kick stand seems a bit flimsy.The Camera - The video recording component forgets its settings every time you close out. Not a huge issue for me but it could be for some.The Big Picture:All in all the HTC Surround is a solid WP7 Device. You should not, I repeat should not buy this device for its speaker. It is a great all around smartphone with a great screen, good performance and great feel, that just happens to have a nice slide out speaker system, not the other way around. If you are looking for a device without a physical keyboard that is thin light and sturdy with good performance that is priced competitively this is a great choice.",1.0

CNPGD All-in-1 Watch Cell Phone & Smart Watch Sync to Android IOS Smart Phone (Silver),,59.99,4,"Just got the watch and I have to say I like it! it is slightly thick but not terrible. The only gripe I have for now is the setup to my phone. WHAT A PAIN IN THE ASS.. it will connect but then it doesnt pair. After an hour of putzing with it, I found out the best thing to do is install the software using the QR Code on the watch (very cool by the way) then pair with the phone. Unpair with the phone. Turn off the BT on the watch and the phone. Turn the BT back on on both devices then connect. Viola! it starts working. The remote camera option is cool if not a little creepy. Seems like it could be used for less than legal practices.. I will use and report back further issues.. If Any..EDIT: 1 Week review..So I have had this watch for a week and would like to update you on my findings. After trying all the features i have come to the conclusion that this is still a fun device to have. The sleep monitor, Working but always says poor nights sleep. I am assuming it uses the motion sensor for this and how much you move during the night. As i am a restless sleeper, the watch is spot on.. Connection to the phone: This is where the watch lacks. Patience is a virtue on this. It will connect and stay connected as long as you are in range of your phone. 10 or more feet in a normal setting. I have noticed any location that has metal studs or office environment, The range is 2-3 feet at best. Not a big deal since they have crammed so much into this watch that the antenna for BT couldn't be very large. If it does drop, simply touch the messages button and touch connect and it will reconnect. It will bring up all the notifications it missed while disconnected and it does do almost ALL notifications including facebook. It only will bring up contacts and messages it you choose the bluetooth option for each on the watch. IT DOES NOT SAVE ANYTHING TO THE WATCH. It has to download contacts and messages each time you choose it. Depending on your phone it can take a few seconds. Cell phone option: I didn't get a chance to ry this but i did put a SIM card in and it picked up the network fine. For those of you who cant get the browser to work, It only works with the cell service. The watch does not pull the internet from your phone. The Pedometer: Works great but does have a delay. Not a big deal since you arent staring at the watch while you walk. It will catch up. Finally the software setup.. I have tried many sotwares in the hope the watch will stay connected. I have decided the watch is to blame for the distance (not a deal breaker). Do not use the QR code on the watch as the software it installs is an old version. Simply go to the play store and search ""Bluetooth Notification"" and install. The best part is you don't need to turn off any security. Also it is the same software that is on the watch but with updates through the store and a newer version. Open the app and turn it on. Then simply Pair the watch.. MAKE SURE YOU INSTALL THE SOFTWARE FIRST BEFORE PAIRING! In conclusion, this watch is very comfortable on the wrist and is a little think but not terrible. My only major gripe besides the connection issues is the fact that the USB port on the watch is NOT covered. I have found myself being very careful around water (washing hands, rain etc.) the port faces your hand and is very easy to get water in there. Don't be discouraged, the watch is $40 so the little things are tolerable. Have fun with it and don't expect a Moto 360. It is what it is and does a great job doing it!",15.0

"Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679",Samsung,119.99,5,"The mobile is excellent for the price-fast enough for my mobile needs while on 4g-and connects effortlessly with WiFi. One downside is being able to shut off the shutdown tone (was able to download Silent Boot app for booting up silently) and that the mobile won't autostart with an alarm set (found out this was not available on Android OS). Apparently one can root the OS to change the shutdown tone (Linux users will recognise this function) but I don't want to void any warranty at this point.Samsung mobile phones that I have owned have been consistently very good to excellent (the others were Java-based mobiles). Samsung support was informative when I asked them about the auto-start with the alarm.Be aware that this mobile does ship with a T-Mobile activation kit-so one does not need to buy an additional kit. I had contacted Amazon about the activation kit being included when I read another reviewer's post to verify, but unfortunately the chat agent told me the wrong information (said that there was not an activation kit inlcuded). Sure enough, the mobile ships with everything you need except at microSD card (if you want more data storage).

However, I called the Amazon Customer Services people. At the begging they were trying to shift the responsibility somewhere else, but after I talked to one of the top managers who was very helpful and agreed that Amazon should make it clear that whenever you buy something that cost more than $700 or $1000 or whatever amount, they will have to do the verification process which will take up to 2 business days. Anyway, that top manager at Amazon made it very easy for me. He got me an express mail that solved the whole problem, but I was on the phone for about an hour to reach that powerful manager. The company was excellent. That is just advice and sharing experience for whom are willing to buy it through Amazon.",2.0

Unlocked Quad-band S29 Smart Watch Phone Support Camera TF Card Micro SD Card SIM Card Bluetooth Wrist Smartwatch,,59.99,3,"In general, it's a fairly nice watch and works with the 'BT Notification' and the 'Mediatek SmartDevice' app. The latter allows for very intricate configuration of app and system service notifications (Android only). Four main negative issues:1) While the device is truly 64M ROM and will take firmware updates found in the xda developers forum, this hardware does not work properly with those firmware: screen appears upside down with other issues.2) This device implies you can set custom wallpaper, but when a new image is set, it never actually gets applied. I've tried 128x128 and 240x240 sized images in both gif and jpg formats. I may have even tried png.3) The Bluetooth utility does not have a ""search"" feature like my DZ09. This means that if you will have a problem trying to connect Bluetooth headphones or headset that rely on the ""Smart"" device to initiate the pairing. So I have not been able to pair my headphones that I used to workout with.4) The pedometer does not seem as accurate as my DZ09 and none of the Android apps I've tried on my Samsung Avant seem to work with calculating the data from the watch into meaningful results (calories, etc). But this has been the case with the DZ09 as well (I tried a number of apps on my single Avant and tried reboot combinations of all sorts but could not get the apps to receive data even though the phone did ""connect"" to the watches successfully.",

Drawbacks for me is that there isn't an microSD expansion slot (32GB is pretty large, though); Battery life really sucks (I lose nearly half my charge in less than 8hrs); Bluetooth disconnects frequently while in use; Phone gets hot when using car charger (which is often due to poor batter life).

NEW SONIM XP3300 FORCE BLACK RUGGED UNLOCKED PHONE,,79.99,1,"I bought this for someone who works in construction. It falls on a daily bases and has not taken any damage to date. The writing on the screen is kinda small and cannot be adjusted. It is also impossible to remove the phone from the belt clip before it stops ringing. And you can't use it in the clip since the clip covers some of the buttons. The charger and the headset uses two different ports yet the connector is exactly the same. These ports are also located next to each other sometimes causing confusion, especially in the dark.UPDATE** After just 6 months the rubber case has begun peeling off. Other folks at work are complaining about the same issue and Sonim says its cosmetic damage and the warranty does not cover cosmetic damage although the peeled of parts means that the device is no longer water and dust proof.",6.0

PRIV by BlackBerry Factory Unlocked Smartphone - Black (U.S. Warranty),BlackBerry,349.98,5,"Bought this because I hate being without QWERTY.

Because those phones had such a sad user experience for me, a waited a while to buy the PRIV. I really wish I didn't wait so long. This phone is great. It does everything I want it to do. No more frusterated typing on touch screens anymore. I can just flip the keyboard out. Both cameras are great. It runs apps perfectly.I can type notes up quickly and accurately.I don't have to slide my greasy fingers across the screen when reading articles, because I can slide them around the keyboard/trackpad instead. It's even got a little swipeable ""edge"" tab at the one side. The only improvements I could suggest are that I wish it had a better battery life , and I wish I could switch though songs by holding the volume buttons.Either way, this is a new phone I actually like. I hated settling with phones that are nothing but screen . I hate those phones so much they all look the same and they're so ugly. So boring and I hate waiting for the keyboards to come up just for them to take up half the screen. Not to mention typing in the cold or with long nails or without looking at those phones is a freaking nightmare. This phone is the best.",0.0

They told me to contact Samsung yet another time, who confirmed what they said earlier.The thing to keep in mind is if you buy an unlocked phone from Mobile Connections you have NO WARRANTY. No one will repair it and Mobile Connections will not help you.It's important to add when they originally sold this item to me the title was ""Samsung Galaxy S6 SM-G920i Unlocked Cellphone, 32GB, Black Sapphire."" The recently added ""no warranty"" to the title because of my interaction with them, all the while not telling me they had a change of policy and that they just decided to not honor warranties in anyway.Moral of the story, don't trust Mobile Connections.",8.0

CNPGD MultiFunction All-in-1 Watch Cell Phone & Smart Watch Sync to Android IOS Smart Phone (Silver),CNPGD,79.99,2,"kinda huge headache. Bought this for my best friend for Christmas since she has a job that won't allow her to have her phone at her desk but she is allowed things like smart watches, we wanted to be able to get ahold of her quickly if there was an emergancy at home. She opened it, played with it for about 20 minutes before the screen began to blink and stop responding to any touch on the screen or the button. Sent it back, at my own expense, and had a new one sent out. They did send an extra battery to sort of reimburse me for the shipping costs, which was good because the battery that was on the second watch when it got here exploded shortly after being turned on, but thankfully didn't damage the watch. The description for the item is a little unclear. This doesn't work WITH your smart phone, it IS a smart phone. It needs it's own sim card to be able to use all the functions, My friend almost had me send it back again because the touch screen isn't very sensitive at all. She says it will randomly stop responding to touch when used regularly. For the most part she doesn't really use it because of how frustrated she gets with it being glitchy all the time.",0.0

Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime Dual Sim Factory Unlocked Phone White Blanco,Samsung Korea LTD,184.9,4,"This is a very nice device. Nice display and easy to use. I like it a lot. Unfortunately, the 8 GB of memory is a shortfall for the device. The storage is used up very fast. I added external memory and that is where I store photos and such but there is still the matter with internal memory usage. Adding additional programs is an issue because they would rather be on the internal memory instead of the external memory and there is very little. 16 GB would be much nicer. One last issue would be registering this device with Samsung for the warranty. Apparently this device is meant to be sold in another country so registering it here in the USA is not possible. Samsung sent me a link to register the device for other countries but, I don't know what country to select. With that said, it has not been registered with Samsung.

"Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679",Samsung,119.99,5,"This is my first smart phone and I was lured in by the reasonable price and T-Mobile's new $30 unlimited text, unlimited data, 100 minutes plan. I simply could not justify the expense of phone and data before. I think this phone is great value for $200. It has almost every feature I want. The only thing I would have really liked would be a 5mp camera like on the Galaxy S. I handled a Galaxy S and was considering buying a refurbished one of those for $150 more before deciding on the Exhibit II. I don't regret saving the money. Unless you've had a higher quality phone before, or you're comparing this side-by-side with something higher end, you won't feel limited or cheated by this phone. It's got a very crisp vibrant display, runs quick and smooth, and even with the 3.2mp camera I've taken some decent photos. Sure beats my previous phone anyway. Battery easily lasts me from 6am to late in the night. I haven't had it actually die on me yet. I don't know how my usage might compare to others, but I use Facebook and email frequently throughout the day, have tried out the GPS navigation a couple of times, used Google Music, surfed a bit of news, and played Words With Friends. The display is the biggest battery drain I think, so I keep that down pretty low all the time. I don't do much talking, hence getting the plan with only 100 minutes, so I can't say how much battery is affected by talk time.Only a couple of gripes... As others have mentioned, the beep when the battery is charged is annoying. I charge my phone by my bed at night and I still want to be able to receive emergency calls and texts so I'm not going to put it on silent in order to avoid that beep. But it does wake me up. Still, I can live with it.Sometimes texts fail to send and I've seen other people in forums with this problem too. Also the texting app is glitchy and doesn't always respond to your taps in the text area to bring up the keyboard.Yes, the back cover is as slippery as everyone else says. I bought the gel skin case for the Galaxy W (same phone as the Exhibit II, just rebranded outside the US) and I'm so glad I did. I would certainly have dropped the phone repeatedly by now if I didn't have the skin.Overall, I highly recommend this phone. Excellent price for $200, especially if you're been holding out for a while for the price of smart phones and data plans to drop.",5.0

HTC Desire 816 Dual Sim Unlocked Smartphone (White) LTE 900 / 1800 / 2100 / 2600 - International Version No Warranty,HTC,221.0,2,"Update May 2015:I am very disappointed to report that my HTC 816 broke after just using it for 4 months. Unfortunately, because I bought it online, there is no warranty, so I am out the $300+ that I spent on it and the case. It happened when I went overseas. I had gotten a SIM card from the country I was in to use my phone there. Around the same time, my phone started over-heating and the download arrow at the top of the phone looked as if it were continuously downloading something, and would run for hours. I'd turn off the phone because it was over heating, but when I'd turn the phone on again, I'd continue to have the same problem. Then the screen became less and less sensitive to touch until it became completely non-responsive and I couldn't use any application or function on the phone at all. I don't know if it's a problem with the phone itself, or the SIM card from overseas that caused the problem. It would cost $100 to have the screen repaired at HTC, but I think I'll just buy a new phone. I am SO disappointed because I loved my new phone - everything worked perfectly until the overheating/screen problem, and I'd only had it for 4 months. I will not make the mistake of buying a phone without warranty again.December 2014 review:I have had my HTC phone for about 3 weeks, and I love it. My old phone was an iPhone, which I couldn't wait to get rid of. It took a couple days to become familiar with the android system, but it wasn't as difficult as I thought. The screen is large and has great resolution. The pictures taken on the 13 mp camera look great - I'm amazed how good the low-lighting pictures turned out - they were even better than ones taken with my real camera. The speakers are loud with good sound quality. The phone fully charges in about 3 hours, and has a long battery life - longer than the iPhone or Samsung Galaxy. I usually go 1 1/2 to 2 days between charges. You can set the screen unlock to either swipe or PIN. It has 8 GB of internal memory, and unlike with an iPhone which doesn't allow extra memory, you can add up to 128 GB of storage.I liked that it has 2 SIM slots - unfortunately, my carrier Metro PCS doesn't provide service to dual SIM phones - they only provide the SIM for one slot, not both. I'm still going to make good use of the 2nd SIM slot when I travel overseas.There was some confusion when I first got the phone and was calling around for carriers who could support the dual SIM on my phone. Some carriers I contacted told me one SIM slot was for GSM, the other was for CDMA. As I found out in the end, both slots are for GSM SIM cards. I took the phone to Sprint, Metro PCS, T--Mobile and Verizon, and they all told me that at this time they will not connect my unlocked phone to their system, even though they have the ability to do so. They are not required to connect unlocked phones to their network, and do not want to, since they want people to buy their locked phones so they can lock people into 2 year contracts and get people to pay more over the 2 year term. Metro PCS and Consumer Cellular were the only ones I found who would connect the unlocked phone to their service.As was noted in other reviews, it appears this phone was intended to be sold in the Chinese market - the newsfeed and Tips & Help were in Chinese, even though all of the Language settings were in English U.S. I took off the newsfeed because I don't use it, but I can't seem to change Tips & Help to English. I've tried to have Chinese speakers look on the Tips & Help to see if there's a language setting that's different than the phone settings, but there isn't one.Other than that, I am very pleased with my phone, and would highly recommend it.",8.0

"Samsung Galaxy J7 LTE (2016) J710M/DS 16GB - 5.5"" Dual SIM Factory Unlocked Phone (Black)",Samsung,269.95,4,"So Far Samsung has impressed me with another great phone. I went to this particular version because my last phone (Samsung Note 3) was only a single Sim card phone. This new phone is a dual sim card unlocked smartphone.It's roughly the same size of my Note 3, but feels considerably lighter. Learning curve was extremely short since it acts and responds much like my Note 3 but with some upgrades.I love being able to switch back and forth between two different networks because of the dual sim card capability and enjoy even more the individuality I get out of it and the settings; allowing me to tailor rings and notifications so I can differentiate between numbers and networks when I get incoming calls and messages.The screen is very vibrant and the photo/video quality are impressive for a device capable of doing so many different tasks. Battery life is sufficient for my needs - constant use over a 12-hour shift drops me from 100% down to 30%. This is all under the strain of playing games, surfing the internet and sending messages.And, since I already owned other Samsung devices, initial setup allowed me to effortlessly sync with those devices to migrate over exactly what I wanted on this phone. It's also a big plus that I can put a 128GB micro SD card in this phone as well.I do wish that both SIM ports were 4G LTE capable, but, once again for the way I utilize it, it's limitations in that area are acceptable.All-in-all, if you're looking for a good quality smartphone that is dual Sim card capable. This is a pretty good choice. It was reasonably priced - well under $300, and shipping was pretty fast. HOWEVER, be sure to confirm the seller is in fact sending you a DUAL SIM phone. The first vender I dealt with sent me TWO single sim phones although they claimed they were DUAL SIM capable - talk about being ticked off!!!! But once I switched to another vendor, I got the phone for a few bucks less and exactly what I wanted.As long as the longevity is there, I suspect I'll be happy with this phone for years to come.",3.0

Apple iPhone 5s 64GB (Space Gray) - T-Mobile,Apple,92.86,5,"Upgraded from from a 4s that met an unscheduled demise. Was pretty burned about it until my 5s showed up in the mail. If you keep your phone locked, the fingerprint ID alone is worth the upgrade. One touch and you're in! Punching in a code every time you want to access your phone seems so archaic. All the other features are just icing on top. I'm one of those who is just not into this current fad of gargantuan cell phones just to have a big screen. I loved the size of the 4, and after having the 5 for awhile I think it's the perfect size. Still easy to ""one-hand"" the phone and still easily slips into your front jeans pocket.

Nokia Lumia 930 International Version No Warranty Unlocked Black,,208.0,5,I have had this phone for over a month and used it on my 19 day European vacation. I have to tell you that it's the BEST phone I have ever had. The pictures it takes are amazing. The living images combined with the storyteller app really just blow your mind. A still photo says a lot but adding the movement you get with living images adds that extra dimension to really convey the feeling of the subject matter. I highly recommend this phone to anyone living in the US even though you won't get full 4G since it's designed with European LTE bands and not the US bands. I happen to be connected to WiFi the majority of the time so it's not an issue for me. I have ATT and I just had to have the sim card cut to nano size and insert into the device. If you do this do not advise ATT that you switched devices. They will want the IMEI # and since it isn't designed or the US you may have connection issues. Just insert the nano SIM and you will be good to go!! Everyone who saw this phone in action wanted one.,44.0

BLU Life 8 XL Smartphone - Unlocked - Global GSM - White,BLU,125.99,3,"12/14/15 Update on lollipop upgrade, I have tried to get answers on why no upgrade, but all requests have fallen on deaf ears. Can't believe 5 months have past with no upgrade as promised, definitely false advertising. If they chose to respond I will post it.Lets start by saying that $79 for this phone is worth it.I like the screen, nice and bright and as sharp as it needs to be.I love the look, Mine is a solid build no light seepage like in one review.For basic cell phone uses, it works. I've played manysimple games, some with lag issues. But phone calls, texts, wifi allwork as they should. There are a few issues with the OS, that I hopedLollipop would fix, but there is no update(as of today) to the phoneas advertised in their sales ads. Many Tech site reviews claimed Blusaid the update was due by the end of July. But no where have Iseen Blu say that, so now it's a waiting game.I use my phones on Cricket, there is 4g lte in the area,This phone has 4g speed capabilities, and says it is connectedto 4g, but I have mostly been getting 3g 1-1.6 mbps. I'll keep testing.The notification light is almost impossible to see unless your in a poorly lit area.Touchscreen is touchy and came with screen protector on, which I removedand bought a glass one, it's ok not great.The camera is ok, not top of the line by any means, but noteven close to the worst I've used.I have watched Amazon video, Netflix, Crackle and Youtube on this phoneand all worked as expected, no issues.When buying a smartphone you also ""buy"" customer support. I wouldsay that this is by far the weakest link. When trying to contact Blu I gotthe run around after multiple tries to get a question answered.This is my 3rd blu phone. The phone is not bad at all for less than $80and at that price I would buy it again, but at $130 I would pass.",1.0

GreatCall Jitterbug5 Easy-to-Use Cell Phone and Medical Alert Device for Seniors - Blue,Jitterbug,99.99,1,"There is a lot to like about the phone itself: with its large numbers on the screen and big buttons it should be very senior-friendly. But my complaint, and the reason I returned the phone, is with Great Call, the outfit through which phone service is provided. It's unfortunate there are no alternative service providers for this phone.First of all, I never got the phone activated. Entering the serial number on the Great Call web site kept producing a message that the serial number was invalid. After calling Great Call, the first person I spoke to agreed that the serial number was invalid. The serial number was on both a card included with the phone, and on the box the phone came in, and they matched. He kept asking me where I got the phone, apparently trying to get me to admit that I bought it used or stolen, out of someone's trunk instead of off Amazon. Eventually that first person transferred me to the ""Activation Department"".The Activation Department guy was sure we would be able to activate the phone, but he needed a credit card before he could even try. And he said the process would take about 25 minutes! I'm sorry, but I've activated enough software and hardware in my day to know there's no reason I shouldn't be able to do so through their web site. And if I absolutely have to talk to a person about it, there's no way it should take 25 minutes. I told him if that's a sample of how ""user-friendly"" the Jitterbug was going to be, there's no way my 86-year-old relative would be able to use it. And I returned the phone.",5.0

I guess I can understand now why it was offered at a price like this, you can really tell the difference but at least the software is still the same.

It cannot compare to other phones since this is the first for me.The camera takes great pictures, but it is slow to start up and I between shots, so not good for action shots. It is not quick to change any camera setting, so I usually end up using Auto mode most of the time to avoid missing out on quick shots.Battery life is not the longest, so I have to recharge every night. I listen to audiobooks without head phones and use the camera and checking emails. If you use the camera a lot you might not even make it through the day without charging.

VERIZON LG OCTANE CELL PHONE!,LG,80.99,3,"I like my Octane, basically because it's very much like my enV3 I passed down to my granddaughter. BUT ... even though it's set at HIGH, since the speakers are inside the phone, with no outside opening, it's not very easy to hear when it rings. I have to put the phone face down to hear it a little better if I'm not right next to it. The other problem is the 2-minute reminder if I miss a text .... it's VERY LOW, and there's no way to make it louder. I check the phone often to make sure I haven't missed a text or call.",2.0

"Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",Sony,329.99,3,"Before I decided to buy this phone, numerous reviews and researches had been done. Then this phone became my final choice.This is a decent phone. There are quite a few concerns online over the battery, screen resolution, and the main camera's lack of optical image stabilizer.Well, I'd like to say that after having this phone for couple of days, the only thing I don't find entirely satisfying is the main camera. Although it comes with 21.5 mega pixels, the quality of the photos really isn't any better than the main camera on the LG G3, which has 13 mega pixels.The 1920x1080p screen is great, and sometime can be rather too bright, but such problem can be taken care of by dialing the brightness down several notches.Battery wise, when it's fully charged, two 120mins movies on Netflix, 20 plus photographs taken with flash, on and off web browsing, numerous text messages exchange on two messengers, all done in the time span of 7 hours, can be sustained by the battery with still 8% left.It also doesn't take more than two hours to fully charge the battery, despite some reviews online. I have noticed that it has taken about a minute to charge a little more than 1% of the power. From 3% to 100%, the battery on my phone took about 93 minutes.Another thing is that I have watched a review on You Tube about somebody claiming that this phone doesn't allow apps to be saved on the additional memory card. Well, I have no problem transfer most of my apps on to the SD card, so just for the reference.Anyway, for a mid-range phone at this price, it is not bad.",0.0

Nokia Lumia 635 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8.1 Quad-Core Phone - Black,Nokia,75.99,5,"I don't own a Mercedes Benz, I drive everyday cars that get the job done and don't kill my bank account. I may not be a mainstream thinker on this topic - IT IS A PHONE folks.....and yes, it can do email, surf the web, and a lot of other things. For less than $100, this phone does pretty much everything you need. My everyday car is not as fast, comfortable, or advanced as a new Mercedes - and didn't cost $80K either.The things I like:- inexpensive (even if you drop it and break it, you can buy five of these compared to a Galaxy S6)....- small and light - fits in my pocket; screen isn't as big as some of the other smartphones - fine with me; more than adequate for most uses - not phablet-like at all- I have used Android devices - did not find them intuitive; Windows 8.1 phone is very simple to use and understand; very short learning curve - if any at all- Windows Phone 8.1 UI is quite pleasant to look at and customize-able, settings and setup are self evident for the most part, no frustrations- Battery life; so far, more than adequate - all day use with plenty of battery left- call quality; excellent call quality and connectivity: Nokia does understand it is a PHONE first........- Apps - does it have the tens of thousands of apps that Android has? No - it has more than enough and - all the essentials - what is the problem?- attitude - so far, no body has laughed at me for buying a Windows Phone; they like the interface when they look at it....besides, do you care what they think?- great integration with MS Office and One Drive for backup and file transfers....WiFi connectivity works great, is fast, updating works flawlessly- Didn't cost me $600.....did I mention that?- it just works.........hasn't frozen yetThings that could be better:- screen brightness - not as bright as the $600 phone..........OK, I get that - it is good enough- Doesn't have a Samsung logo on itIf you are not in love with smartphone design or culture - make a smart choice; do it.",0.0

BLU T176T Jenny TV 2.8 Unlocked Quad-Band Dual SIM Phone (Black/Blue),BLU,74.47,4,"I travel extensively, and am used to swapping out SIM cards. I needed a ""local phone"" and spent time on Amazon looking for inexpensive phones that ""just worked"" and always saw BLU popping up in search results. I looked at the price and took a pass, figuring that they're not worth it at that price and looked at things that were 3x the cost. But I took a chance and bought the Jenny TV 2.8 and figured, why not?I was pleasantly surprised.It's a quad-band GSM phone, so it'll work all over. The phone feels light and is very plastic-y, yet solid and took a few accidental drops without any issues. Swapping between local SIMs in Europe was no problem, and I appreciated this a lot. The call quality was nice. The Jenny TV did a halfway decent job of taking photos (for a $30 phone, I didn't expect much). What I did like the most was the fact that I could throw in up to a 32gb microSDHC card and use this as a mp3 player. I loved that it had a radio and worked well to try to listen to local music. The TV will only pick up analog signals, so it's virtually useless inside the US and will become more useless over time. The battery is rated at 10 days and after a week with some phone calls, the phone was still going strong.The phone works, with features that would have been amazing nearly 10 years ago. However, it's $30 and it works. If I lose it or it breaks, I won't feel bad about it. It's a solid travel phone or for someone who just needs a phone, not a smartphone.",

I guess I thought, ""Even if it is a refurbished phone, who cares? As long as it works."" So I bought it, and at first I was quite pleased. The battery drained quickly, but other than that, everything was fine. That was before I tried to get a data plan (when I was just using the phone for talking and texting). I've spent six hours at the T-mobile store over the past two weeks trying to trouble-shoot this thing, and the techies there say they've never seen anything like it. The phone cannot access the data plan I have. At first we thought it was due to corrupted software, so we replaced it. But even with the software overhaul, the phone doesn't allow you to switch from ""Hotspot Browser"" (wifi) to ""Internet Browser"" (to be used with any carrier's data plan). It's really strange. But it defeats the point of having a SmartPhone if you can only access the internet and email when you can get wifi. Thank God I bought a warranty to go with it. I'll definitely be sending this thing back. It's not worth the headaches, time, money, and inconvenience. Don't buy!",0.0

Screen is the best i have seen. 5,7 inches Quad HD with an amazing brightness just bring videos and pics to life. Plus reading the news or even books in this screen is really easy.2. Camera is also the best i have used so far. Wide angle shots, screen editing etc.3. Heart rate monitor and UV monitor.4. Battery life is AMAZING for a phone with this screen and resolution size.5. The pen! What can I say about the pen!! It is amazing, i find myself using the pen a lot more ofter than the keyboard. It has a very high accuracy level for writing or even editing pics plus another array of functions that are really cool.6. Design: leather back with aluminum vessel. This phone looks really sexy.7. Lightning fastThe bad:1. Phone has tons of options, but you have to take your time to dig into them. so if you are not really into this sort of things, I would recommend a phone that is more simple like the LG G3.2. It is a big phone! If you don't have big pockets or a purse to carry it around you may not like it.3. No customizable keyboard.Overall this is the best phone i have ever had.

SONY XPERIA Z3 D6603 LTE 16GB (FACTORY UNLOCKED) INTERNATIONAL MODEL- COPPER,,299.99,1,I am so disappointed this is my last Sony phone. I bought a z1 and less than a month after it died and i had to get it refunded. However i still love the phones so i bought a z3 for my birthday 2 months ago and today while at the pool taking pictures the phone just went black and that's it. I opened the flaps to check if water got in and inside was dry so i thought it was the battery that had died because it was dying. Took it home and plugged it in to charge and nothing it just gets warm. Now i am pissed and trying to see how i can get it replaced only to find that the time for me to return it has passed. I bought this phone because of it's playstation integration and the waterproof quality. If i had seen water inside the charge port i would feel better knowing that it was my carelessness that caused but they were both sealed and functioning as they should so why did my phone die?,0.0

She was not yet eligible for an upgrade, so I picked this up for her. When the phone was working it did exactly what was asked, and was great for texting. However, like others have had issue with, the phone would occasionally just restart. Along with that messages would sometimes get stuck in limbo (wont send or receive).NOTE: Once my mom was eligible to upgrade she upgraded to a smart phone, as the feature phones available are junk. Unfortunately this is the best of the worst, but seeing as Verizon wants to shove a data plan down everyone's throat I can see why they are trying to kill feature phones.",0.0

Because he has killed so many cell phones as of late that our cell phones insurance will no longer insure any phone on his line. Looking over all the cell phones he has loved and some how destroyed I noticed he specially liked the Droid 4. It had good battery life for the super user he is, it had a full keyboard that he likes, and it serves at a hot spot wonderfully for other devices without getting overly hot. I gave this cell phone 4 stars because this is not a newer phone and people I think need to be aware of that if they don't know it already.

Motorola Photon Q XT897 Sprint CDMA 4G LTE Dual-Core Android Smartphone w/ Touchscreen + Slide-out Keyboard - Black,Motorola,95.0,1,"I purchased this phone to replace my old Photon Q (19 months into contract w/ Sprint) which had a problem with it's charging port. It was supposedly new and it was cheaper than an Asurion Insurance refurb and I could get it next day (Asurion was telling me 5 business days for a refurb replacement). When I first got the new device, I checked to make sure it was actually new and not refurbished. It was new! It worked perfectly and just as well as the old Photon Q I had... until two months later.One day I went to turn on the screen and nothing appeared. Slid the keyboard out; still nothing. Reboot by holding the power key and down volume; nothing. I could still feel the haptic feedback from the screen and the phone was functioning in the sense that it would ring/vibrate and I could answer incoming calls by swiping in the general area of the screen that I always used before to answer calls.I took it to a Sprint store and and they tried to fix it. I brought my old phone in hopes they could scavenge part off of it to fix the new one, but the phone was shot. The tech that tried to fix my phone told me that a lot of the Photons he had seen had similar problems. I ended up with a refurb Photon Q from Sprint (which was another comedy of errors) for the remainder of my contract and then got a Galaxy S5 once I was out of contract.I would probably avoid this phone even if you are similar to me and like having a physical keyboard. Not just for the fact that the design is over 2 years old, but also the phones seem to be hit or miss when it comes to build quality and reliability.",1.0

I run a Hotmail, Outlook, Outlook Exchange (Business), OneDrive, Business OneDrive Dropbox and personal Cloud server. A It has a Great Wells Fargo App and can do encryted VPN. Internet sharing is available but blocked by reseller Tracphone. (They want you to buy their Straight Talk WiFi hotspot. Tracphone and StraightTalk same company). This was a replacement for an annoying Android phone that lasted less than a year also. Only real drawback is the lack of applicatons that every Windows Phone user should let their favorite stores or site know are needed. Amazon does not have a Windows phone either and biased toward Android (Goobgle). My only reason for the low rating is the unexpected screen blanking problem. It appears the phone still thinks it is charging or doesn't have enough power for screen. It also only blanks the main screen area and displays the header (signal bars, WiFi, battery level) and bottom navigation keys. My wife liked mine so much she wanted one also. Hers is still working fine. As another customer complained, after the screen times out, neither the double tap wake-up or pressing the power button returns screen. I found that applying power brought screen back and as long as the screen is up there are no isses. Otherwise a four star rating. I will be contacting Nokia on any warranty as phone is needed for work.This is the Breed reseller's, fulfilled by Amazon, response when it comes to warranty:""Please check with the manufacturer as for any U.S. Warranty is voided. Furthermore, once you purchased your device, you will be given 60 days for a refund and 90 days for an exchange. Any physical or water damages void your warranty with us.""",0.0

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,4,"Just received this phone. Everything seems to work as it should. No issues at all. Pictures aren't bad at all. Wondering if folks complaining that photos are blurry removed the film covering the lens? Power drainage does seem a bit quick, but I installed an app killer to conserve battery and it's fine. Mostly using this phone for business and light social media, so not burning the battery by playing games (that is what my tablet is for).Edit July 31, 2015: So I've had this phone for a little over a week. Everything still functioning with no glitches or hiccups. The only complaint is that the vibration feature on the phone is weak. Unless I have it in my hand, I wouldn't hear the buzz or feel it in my pocket. Oh, I also noticed some blurry pictures. The camera tries to auto focus constantly, so if you have a shaky hand, your pics will blur. To remedy this, you can play around in the camera settings so that you don't leave it all up to the phone to auto adjust everything when taking pictures. In regards to the battery, I found that it drains faster if you toy around with the phone (swiping back and forth on screen, opening and closing apps), instead of leaving it alone while streaming something. For example, I would boot up a music app and a run tracker app for my exercise routine. The run app is known to be an energy hog. I would run for about 2 hours when the battery is at 98% and come home to check and it would be at 78%. That's not too bad. But! If I start playing around with the phone trying to upload my run log and check messages or emails afterward, I can lose 5%-10% battery life in 5 minutes. For this reason, I highly suggest getting a portable battery bank if you are considering to get this phone.",2.0

Nextbit Robin Factory Unlocked Phone - Midnight (1-Year U.S. Warranty),,249.99,5,I have been waiting on the Nextbit Robin since its Kick Starter campaign. When I saw that Amazon was offering it at the pricethat early adopters on Kick Starter got I had to pull the plug and buy one. I love this phone. It feels great in the hand. It is very lightin weight. The screen resolution and brightness is fantastic even in bright outdoor light. I read a lot about the speakers being poorin sound quality but believe me they are not. I find that I have really turn them down more often than not and the clarity of the sound isspot on. Both the front and back cameras do a fantastic job of capturing images for both photos and movies. Robin is a pure Androiddevice in that it doesn't come with all the bloatware that comes with most other phones. It will get updates from Android at the sametime they roll out to Google's own smart phones so you don't have to wait months for an update.My only complaint with this phone (as with most phones today) is battery life which I would put at marginal. I tend to usemy phone for streaming videos and I know that is part of the reason why the battery doesn't last very long. I can stream about 31 1/2 hour movies before I have to recharge the battery. The good thing is that it comes with USB C with quick charge and I cancharge the phone back to full in a couple of hours.I HIGHLY recommend this phone to anyone looking to buy a new phone.,5.0

"BLU Studio 6.0 Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,292.99,3,"This phone is part of a 5-Way ""$300 Phablet Showdown"" which includes the following devices:6.4"" Sony Xperia Z Ultra $2996.0"" Sony T2 Ultra $2995.7"" LG G Vista $3095.7"" ZTE ZMax $2526.0"" BLU Studio 6 LTE $279and the winner is....NOT the BLU Studio 6 LTE!!! (NOT BY A LONGSHOT)Sorry, BLU! In My Opinion, this is another wasted opportunity to show that your company CAN be relevant.It's not all bad, but it's not good enough, either!PROS:- The 6"" 1080x1920 screenIt is BIG It has a VERY Sharp picture with deep colors, and it's just plain BEAUTIFUL!- The build quality is as good as ANY phone on the market.With its anti-slip back and rounded corners, this phone just fits my hand, and feels good. The buttons are well placed and they have a great feel, even through the TPU rubber case. With the capacitive buttons below the screen, it allows the usable area of the screen to be just that much bigger. Some people don't like the capacitive buttons, but I prefer them.-16 GB of on board storageExcellent storage for a mid-range phone.- It can use an SD Card up to 64GB...compared to 32 GB for many others in this segment.- Apps can be moved to the SD card to further expand storage.Not all manufacturers get this! Sony phones require a software update to make this work, and the ZTE doesn't get it at all. LG gets it, right out the box.-The Camera takes OK pictures and is responsive...although it's a little difficult to use.So it doesn't have the wiz-bang features of the Sony, but the picture quality produced by this 13MP is MUCH better than the 13MP on Sony T2 Ultra. It far outweighs the 8MP offerings on the other 3 phones in this test, as well.- It has an impressive Antutu Benchmark score of approx. 19000.Higher speed processor and 2GB of Ram help this phone rule the Benchmark score. Only the Z Ultra with it's REALLY fast processor and 2GB Ram scored better.- The screen covers an impressive 73% of the surface area of the phone. This is on par with the best of 2014!- In the Box Accessories!Just like the high end units available today, this phone comes with a wired headset. And, exclusive to BLU, the box also contains a TPU Rubber case, and 2 Screen protectors are included, in the box! (at least $30 value, based on Amazon prices) Some would argue that BLU has to do this because you can't buy aftermarket cases and screen protectors for their phones! This may be true, at least for a while after launch (and this phone is BRAND NEW as of December 8th, I believe!!). Historically, though, BLU phones don't get a lot of attention from aftermarket accessory companies. To be fair, the LG G Vista and the ZTE Zmax will probably never get a lot of aftermarket accessories as well.CONS:-It doesn't operate very smoothly!Paging from one homescreen to another should be a lot more fluid. Pulling down the notifications shouldn't feel 'notchy'. Apps should open more smoothly.... and THEY DO, when you use any of a number of Launchers available on the Play Store. (I had my best results with the Nova Launcher- paid edition for $4.99., but the free version was ok, too.) This tells me that a software update may fix this phone's biggest downside, and and it appears that BLU has made provisions for that with the ""Wireless Update"" link under the ""About Device"" menu in ""Settings"" (I could be wrong, but I don't remember the BLU Studio 6.0 HD having a similar update link.).-Bluetooth v.3.0The specs for this phone are hard to find, but when you do find them, they show that it only supports Blutooth v 3.0! That means it won't work with smart watches and most fitness trackers! Low-energy Blutooth v4.0 has been out for a very long time. The BLU Studio 6.0 HD even had BT4.0! I hope this is simply a mistake in the marketing material. If not, this is a tragedy!-It doesn't have very many LTE Radios.It does have the right radios (BAND4 on 1700/2100AWS) for T-Mobile, but it doesn't have the right radios (BAND17 on 700MHz) for Tmobile's upcoming high speed LTE. It also, doesn't have the correct radios for LTE service in most other countries, or on At&t in the US! Not cool BLU. (again, I hope that these stats are mis-quoted but I don't think they are.)-NO aftermarket development community, that I could find.ROOT and ROMS may never be developed for this phone.- Aftermarket accessories may not ever be made for this phone.It would look REALLY sexy in a Terrapin, Ultra Slim Flip Case, like the one available for the Xperia Z Ultra! Will they ever make one that fits this phone? Probably not.- The specs don't indicate Gorilla Glass!Other BLU phones do have it, so if this is their Flagship, I expect it here... BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE IT!- Finally, BLU Tech Support is hard to get in touch with, both on the phone and via email, and THEY DON'T RESPOND TO EMAIL within their 2 day promise!I have asked tech support for info about upcoming fixes and spec clarification (BT3.0???), but BLU has yet to respond.With all these shortcomings, this phone offers a good value in the Sub $300 Phablet Arena, BUT IT's FAR FROM THE BEST VALUE!!! Avoid the frustation and anxiety you get wishing this phone was better, and hoping for fix from BLU that will probably never come!BUY Last year's flagship on Amazon without a warranty.

"BLU VIVO 5R Refresh Smartphone - 5.5-Inch Display 4G LTE GSM Unlocked, GREY",BLU,199.95,4,"I just got this phone today. It was a replacement for my Blu vivo 5 that was lost so I will be comparing the 2.First I have to say that I am extremely disappointed that they went back to micro USB. I loved the USB C charger. It connected so much smoother and doesn't have an up or down side. I know people cry about the lack of accessories but really what more do you plug in there besides a car and home charger? Seems silly to me that anyone would want the micro USB anymore.This phone is more square than the vivo 5. The styling of the vivo 5 reminded me of a skinny, tall iPhone 5. The 5r looks more like a typical andriod with the squared edges aandd slightly rounded back.This phone also runs much hotter than my vivo 5. Shortly after turning it on I noticed it getting warm. I hope this will not be an issue going forward.I still hate that the face does not match the back. Just make a black or white phone not gold/white or grey/black phone. The way the colors are styled on these phones is just tacky.The camera is a bit better but I will need to further test it.I love that the back button is on the right. It's more ergonomic to me as a righty when browsing.I still love these phones for the price. I'll never buy an expensive phone again. These are quick and simple. No crazy learning curves.",2.0

It has performed flawlessly even after being dropped on our tile floor. I even like some of the displays better than my S4 which is probably associated with the S3 operating system. The price was in line with other sellers. Breed shipped the phone right away.I had read a number of reviews on this product advertised elsewhere on Amazon and was concerned about receiving a clone or refurbished phone as described by some other buyers (even from the same seller).

It works really well for the most part, but occasionally when my phone goes dead and I attempt to turn it back on, a strange screen appears. It shows a menu and you have to make a selection, if it happens to you, hit reboot otherwise it does checks on my phone and has automatically called 911 where they left a message on my voicemail. I wasn't happy with that. One of the problems I have with this phone is it takes AT&T or T-Mobile only which have terrible service in my area, but that has nothing to do with the phone. If AT&T and T-Mobile work great in your area then this is a good phone for you. Through Straight Talk it costs me $46.60/month that includes taxes. Don't be fooled with there unlimited data, it's 3GB, then they slow it down. My battery has already fried and needs a replacement as of now. The phone is plastic, but I haven't had any problems with that. It came with a clear rubber case cover and a screen protector which is nice. Nothing fancy but better than nothing. I have had problems lately with my phone calls not showing up on my phone or my history. It doesn't even show up on my voicemail app unless I hit it. I don't know whether that's the phone or the app.? I do like the screen size, it makes it easier to read. I also have problems with trying to upload photos from my phone to my computer. My computer does not recognize the phone. I still haven't figured out this problem after searching through the internet for answers.",0.0

Moto G Play (4th gen.) - Black - 16 GB - Unlocked - Prime Exclusive - with Lockscreen Offers & Ads,Motorola,149.99,5,"Okay, I haven't had this phone for a great length of time just yet, a little less than a month. I must say I was extremely skeptical on this phone because of the price. My previous phone was an LG G3 and it completely died on me. I needed something quick and it needed to be reliable.First I like that this phone is unlocked, this is my first experience with an unlocked phone. I really do like the flexibility of being able to chose my carrier after my contract with Verizon expires.To compare, my LG G3 wasn't a bad phone operating system wise, just the mic truly sucked, and phone calls were extremely muffled. Anyway, the LG G3 just decided to stop connecting to a network, so I was forced to get something else.I read through the many reviews for this phone before making a final decision. And threw caution to the wind and decided to go for it and get it. I am very happy that I did. Seriously for this price for a smart phone, it really does everything my more expensive phone did. Now I am not a gamer, so I can't speak for that, what I can give this review on is the features that I do use.Pros:Set up is extremely easyPhone calls are clearPictures (I was skeptical about) are great!Navigation through apps easyEmail is theredownloading apps, simpleBattery is amazing, lasts a really really long time without having to charge up. And believe me my 4 year old puts that to the ultimate test with her YouTube videos!Really, this is a simple smart phone that anyone can set up.Cons:Haven't really found anything yet.Overall, if you are on a tight budget yet need a good smartphone, I can so far recommend this one. Should anything change I will update my review. However, so far I am very pleased with this phone. I do not have any complaints. Navigating through it's functions is easy. I am still playing around with it for more features (because yeah I am not one to read instructions). The picture quality isn't bad at all, and apps like facebook and instagram seem to work with ease. I did get the one with the Amazon ads constantly being displayed, however, that doesn't bother me at all. I am sure there is a way to turn that off, I haven't explored that option yet because it doesn't really bother me. The Amazon ads that are displayed are only when the phone is in sleep mode.I feel comfortable highly recommending this phone.",1.0

Nokia Lumia 820 8GB GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Smartphone - Black - AT&T - No Warranty,Nokia,99.99,5,"Phone came in the original AT&T box and in great condition as stated. It says it is unlocked, but doesn't work for Sprint. It works perfectly for T-Mobile though. Before this phone, I used a T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G, a first generation android. That was small 3' or so and very light. I wasn't looking for the latest smartphone (iPhone), but something affordable and efficient for basic functions. This phone is it. It's 4'3"" and heavier, but it fits well since I easily drop my phone. It operates on Windows 8 and contains features and apps that are easily accessible and easy to use, such as Facebook, Twitter, Nokia Maps, etc. It has an 8-megapixel rear camera, but a very bad front camera, 0.3 megapixel. Hence, it's decent camera quality. I am a tad sad that I can't take good ""selfies."" Since I use my phone moderately and its functions, its battery life lasts long, though I've only had it for about 3 weeks. Good performance overall and fast connection Internet with 4G.",

"POSH MOBILE TITAN PRO HD ANDROID GSM UNLOCKED DUAL SIM 5.5"" HD SMARTPHONE EXTRA-large HD display, 13MP Camera and 8GB of Storage. 1 Year warranty. (Model#: E550 NAVY BLUE)",Posh Mobile,95.0,5,"While I've only had this a few days, so far it's far better than I expected. A few notes about some issues users report.1. The phone as of 2016-05-18 did NOT work on metropcs, so save your time, at least not in my area. T-Mobile and ATT are fine. I believe some of the entries on amazon say it works on metropcs, that's incorrect. It will work on any network that accepts unlocked GSM phones.2. The usb charger is not hard to work around, all you have to do is take a standard length microusb plug, take a hardware store razor blade, and slice away at an angle from the plastic connector down to the metal part, it's really not difficult, and there's no need to worry about having the slightly longer included cable, I just cut away at about a 45 degree angle and a standard cable fit fine. The case is at a slight angle where the connector meets the body, so that side can be cut away slightly more than the other. Without this cable mod, the connection was erratic using a standard usb cable, with it, it's fine.3. Standby battery life is quite good, but when you use it for anything, the battery drains fast, but that's why it only weighs 52 grams, you can't expect a tiny battery to have a long life, that's not realistic.This little phone is amazing, they've actually managed to cram a full android smart phone onto the device. Typing on it is delicate since the key icons are so tiny, but you actually get the hang of it unless you have thicker fingers.In terms of size, this phone is literally about the same size as just the top lid part of an old flip phone I have.I can't think of a better phone for things like backpacking where you need to have a phone for rides etc, and for me, I prefer this small size, I almost never carry my full sized smart phone because I just don't like that size.I won't know for a year how durable this thing actually is, but honestly, at the price, I don't even care if it fails, you can buy 12 of these for every galaxy or iphone you buy, and they aren't nearly as adorable.",3.0

It seems to b fast I don't have many apps on it so there is no reason for it to b slow right now. when im talking on the phone the ear speaker makes a cracking noise but I can still hear. I have several different Bluetooth headsets some work with this phone some don't. I'm charging my LG headset right now Im hoping it will work. ok now the fact that it only comes with a silicone case and u can't buy cases. I read a review that someone posted it said to order a case for a samsung mega 6.3. I did some comparing b4 i ordered and figured out the HARD CASES WILL NOT WORK. I ordered one of the wallet cases For the mega 6.3. This phone will fit in the silicone case attached to the wallet case but the only things that line up correctly is the camera not the flash and the back speaker. So I got creative and took a razor cut the case off of the wallet case and hot glued the case that came with the phone to the wallet case... PERFECT FIT!! And while I had the razor cut the hole for the flash. it's a great phone for the price!,4.0

Samsung Galaxy S4 I9500 16GB Unlocked GSM Octa-Core Smartphone w/ 13MP Camera - Black,Samsung,309.99,1,"I am from Argentina and I purchased the phone ins the US. I would have never expected the ""so called"" Samsung flagship to have a faulty camera. Accordign to what I checked online this has been a common ocurrence in many cellphones (s4) and even after following every advice I found online I was not able to fix the issue. It seems to be a hardware problem.Basically the camera does not work. Whenever I want to uses the camera the phone freezes and then it display an error message. Only the front camera works.Maybe it was my fault for not checking it, but Samsung does not provide international warranty for the cell phones, though it advertise the S4 I9500 as an international version.So, imagine my dissapointment when someone ask me to take a picture and I have to say, sorry my brand new S4 does not have a working camera. jajaja it is shameful.I can now understand apple user who would never change their iphones.I have had a Galaxy S, an S2, an S3 and an S4.

Apple iPhone 5c 8GB (Yellow) - Verizon Wireless,Apple,179.99,4,"The Good:This was brand new in a sealed box from the vendor I bought it from.Yes this is an unlocked GSM phone.It actually had a T-mobile SIM in it which I popped out and replaced with my AT&T SIM card from my iPhone 5. No problems there.The bad:8GB is straight up not enough memory for an iPhone these days. Photos take up a lot of space as do text messages and emails (you won't really be able to use it as an iPod). By the time the iOS is installed you're down to 5-6GB then things start getting cramped. Seriously, if you have an iPhone go to Settings-General-Usage-Manage Storage and see how large these apps are. Pandora alone is like 150kb. So after deleting a bunch of unused stuff I have 800kb left. That's really not even enough to update the iOS when they release a new one, so I will have to hook this thing to my laptop when that day comes (yes I'm writing this review in it, so it obviously works).In short: but it if you can live with the limitations. If you buy the right case no one will ever even know that it's the cheapest phone Apple makes, but I guarantee you that in very short order you will say to yourself ""I should have got the 16BG one"".",1.0

There are tons of options in the huge menu string, many of which I have no use for but obviously they made it to work on lots of systems.I got the ""white"" phone - but it is more stainless then white. Keypad is white and some edges but the rest is stainless steel. The image makes it look white but think more steel, if that matters, it made me happier, actually. It has a nice substantial feel too it - very thin and smaller then an 2G/3G iphone. The software for the phone/system is easy - makes transferring data from a PC very easy, online updates are available. Was able to put iTunes music on this phone.Battery life of just standby is amazing. I have small hands so the keypad is no issue for me but...I could see it being an issue for others.

LG Nexus 5X Unlocked Smartphone - Mint 32GB (U.S. Warranty),LG,578.0,5,"I recently purchased an iPhone 6s Plus after having an iPhone 6 for nearly a year, and I just didn't like iOS anymore. I've been using iPhones since the iPhone 3GS days, and iOS doesn't really feel like it's changed. I have tried Android several times over the years, but decided to go 100% in this time. I purchased the Nexus 5X because I liked the smaller footprint, and I liked that it came straight from Google. The phone has been a fantastic upgrade so far. The OS is snappy, the device is well built, feels great in the hand, and is quite light. USB-C is great, and the fact that it's reversible is the best part. When I would use Android after using my iPhone, the biggest thing I missed was the reversible Lightning connector. The screen looks great as well, being very vibrant and bright. Touch screen responsiveness is also very precise, and the Nexus Imprint sensor is crazy fast. I thought the Touch ID sensor on my 6s Plus was fast, but this is even faster. I barely have to set my finger on the sensor for the phone to unlock. As a whole, the phone brings one of the best experiences available to the cell phone market (and at a low cost!) I have no problem recommending this device to anyone in the market for a new phone.",11.0

I immediately liked the phone. It responded quickly and I was impressed by the ease of moving everything over from my old Samsung S3. I use Net 10 (on the AT&T network) and it worked right away. This summer I was in Sweden and since I stay for a long time, I have a Swedish sim card from a provider there. All good, EXCEPT, I could only get Edge coverage when I was out and about. I had read about the different bandwidths and thought I was good, but no. Very slow. 2G. Most of the time it said ""no internet"" when I was away from home. The other issue, which I deem a really big one, is the fact that this phone does not have 8GB of internal storage as it says in the ad. For some reason, I think the camera's 8 megapixels got mixed up with the internal storage. My phone has 5.19GB of internal storage. Big headache, even if you don't have a lot of apps. I am a 65-year-old woman with a reasonable amount of apps, but constantly get the message when I update the apps ""cannot update, insufficient storage. Try deleting apps and try again"". So I moved all my apps to the SD card and set the phone to write everything to the card.

I have received the phone in original samsung unopened box. The phone is BRAND NEW and I observed that the phone is not associated with any carrier. It is just from Samsung factory made for UK/UAE region. It's working very well with AT&T and I am enjoying the phone very much. It's very handy size wise and has all features what Galaxy S5 has. Seller/Amazon ships ontime and found price also reasonable. I took the phone to AT&T showroom and they just inserted the new micro SIM and it started working. I love this phone and very beautiful phone working at 4G LTE speeds, but we see H+ symbol with carrier network. AT&T said H+ speed is same as 4G LTE. I recommend this phone to anyone.

Nextbit Robin Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone - Mint (U.S. Warranty),,249.99,5,"I have been cycling through high-end smartphones over the last few weeks trying to find 'the one for me'. And here it is, from left field, the beautiful Nextbit Robin! A stunning phone with great internals and a unique selling point - smart cloud connectivity. I recently got a Blackberry PRIV which is also a beautiful phone with a wonderful hardware keyboard BUT its buggy and inconsistent, runs very hot and is just well, meh! I also tried a Nexus 6P but for me its just too big and lacks any soul, although having the latest Android goodness is always good. The Sony Z5 is a really great phone too but expensive and in some ways, like the screen, just overkill. Well the Robin gives you the best of all worlds; a reasonably stock Android 6 with fast updates, great speakers, a super fast fingerprint reader in just the right place, a beautiful and unusual industrial design and that cloud smart storage. A great concept that smartly manages your storage between the built in 32GB and 100GB of free cloud storage, greying out archived apps but restoring them quickly from the cloud and automatically uploading your photos to the cloud. Hopefully Nextbit will add even more functionality to their cloud implementation moving forward as it has a lot of potential and is just so simple and 'just works' in implementation. I just love the Nextbit launcher, the gorgeous and consistent design of both hardware and software and the thoughtful implementation of Android features. The little cloud logo on the back and the 4 flashing LEDs when it is archiving to the cloud are a nice touch too. All things considered for me its the one! The best smartphone of 2016 so far by far. Keep up the great work Nextbit and all power to your cloud elbow!",7.0

I am very pleased with the delivery. It was really fast.Packed in good manner. Battery was 70% charged, started without any problem. This is unlocked model and I used AT&T SIM to it. It worked without any problem.It is only 1 day since I am using it so it is too early to give any comments. So far it is very good. I haven't faced any problems with it.Very light weight compared to existing windows phone 7 HTC HD7.Call voice quality is not that good but with this cost it is acceptable.UPDATE: AT&T Data plan is not working with this phone. I spoke to AT&T customer service and even if they registered this Phone's IMEI number in the account, Data Communication is still not working. I guess I just wasted the money on this 'Cananda' based phone. Once I used Nokia E72 unlocked phone with AT&T, and it worked like charm. I wish I could have the same Nokia phone handy.UPDATE 8/22/2013: After reviewing an user comment, I realized that I gave wrong feedback. Changing 4 star to 2 Star.

The ringer cannot be set for individual callers (such as my wife so I never miss that call).The hands free speaker is not capable of picking up my voice so can't do direct hands free.That alarm has the most terrible wake up music and instead of gentle waking you, it jolts you awake and although there are choices they are all not suitable. You have to wake up to set the doze button. the minimum alarm you can set is 5 minutes.The worst part is that the phone keeps making a small ding sound telling me the phone has some message . . . which usually is some program that wants to read my e-mails, my contacts or my location. The phone will not tell me which program it is nor can I set a different tone for each program.Want to go crazy? The time is always one hour ahead when roaming and no way to correct it! I did try to change GMT and set it for the cell provider time but neither worked.The camera is workable as long as a flash is not needed. The flash is not coordinated with the shutter so all flash pictures are very dark and not usable. There is no picture stabilization so many pictures come out blurred.",0.0

Waterproof, scratch resistant, and fingerprints don't really show unless you really got greasy ones, fantastic display, great sound quality. I just found it a bit big to hold in my palm, and the volume toggle is not well placed as many have complained about....so why doesn't Sony change it? 4K pics are great and so is the camera, but don't think it's as good as a ""regular"" camera with a bigger lens.

"Nokia C6 Unlocked GSM Phone with Easy E-mail Setup, Side-Sliding Touchscreen, QWERTY, 5 MP Camera, and Free Ovi Maps Navigation (Black)",Nokia,59.95,4,"I came from an N85 so I'm fairly familiar with Nokia phones in general and the Symbian OS in particular.I wanted a touchscreen phone that had a keyboard that was within my budget. I would have gone for the mini N97 but it's a bit pricey considering the C7, N8 et al are coming out soon.I've read almost all available reviews I can read online so if you did that then you know what you're getting into with this phone.The only thing that surprised me was the resistive touchscreen. I bought this phone expecting to return it immediately but the touchscreen compared to my capacitive 2G ipod touch is amazing. It's just as responsive and accurate. I was expecting to need a stylus or my nails to navigate the phone but you really don't!It is, however, a bit bulky but compared to the N85, it's pretty much the same.The NokiaMaps is redunkulous, tho.I LOVE it. The last time I checked it out was when I got my N85. The Nokia maps back then required a crazy-expensive yearly rate to use the turn-by-turn and was pretty much useless bec trying to enter an adddress REQUIRED a zipcode entry before it will search for it! This new interface works much like GoogleMaps (esp with an ovi account) and much easier to use. It has all the feature you can ever want on a stand alone GPS but you get a phone along with it!I specifically bought this phone to try out the NokiaMaps turn-by-turn while I rode my motorcycle. You can't beat an accurate GPS that you can plug your headphones/ bluetooth headset on and use while riding! And if you can find a suitable handlebar holder for the phone, you can mount it and still operate the phone with your gloves on bec of the resistive screen!The speakerphone is on the weakside bec it outputs to only one speaker so that's expected. The battery does not last more than 6 hours bec the data connection is ALWAYS active (bec of the widgets and GPS). It also doesn't charge off the USB but I can use my older Nokia chargers so that's ok.I'll update the downsides of the phone as I find em but so far, the last week of usage have been problem-free.",17.0

So I assumed it must have been a short in the charger so I bought another one. I noticed it felt like it fit better, the original was loose. However, that one ceased to work. So I bought yet another one. Then I figured out it was the port to the phone. I tested the chargers on other devices and they worked fine. So I email the customer service department because it was still under warranty. I got an email back saying to send them proof of purchase. I then called their customer service and was told just to take a screen shot of my order from Amazon. After completing that step and sending them the necessary info, I received an email on how to send the phone back but it also stated that it would take 20 days for me to get it back. I'm expected to go 20 days with no phone. That's ridiculous!! Also, I can only use the bluetooth headphones, if i try to use regular headphones they only work for like 5 minutes then kinda short out.

Unsure if you can register this phone for warranty, doesn't seem to have 4G capabilitiesI saw this phone in a cricket wireless store, though it was all sold out. It seemed like the best option out of the budget phones Cricket is selling it for 100 dollars with activation....not without.Anyway, when first opening the box I noticed how slim the phone is. I also realized that the gold option is very dark/grey like color, so I wish I chose white. It was wasy set up. Though the display resolution is very poor (i feel like my free phone has better quality). This phone is fast though, and has perks like 2 sim card slots, and a fancy processor.

I got this phone in order to get the unlimited text talk and web plan from tmobile. The phone itself is just as good as any other phone on the market and about half the cost. In addition the phone is wifi enabled which allows it to use a wifi connection to extend its network. I live in a very thick apartment complex and couldn't get service with my old verizon phone, but this one gets perfect signal. The only downfall of this phone is that it's not the absolute top quality like some of the other phones when it comes to the processor and video quality.

(MODEL#: S240 PINK)",Posh Mobile,49.91,4,"Bought this little thing on Amazon Prime day for 33 bucks and for 33 dollaroos I was not disappointed. It is novel as heck. Tiny, compact, cute as a button, and functional. I was in love with it right out of the package. It is light and honestly feels like a toy. Like candy should come out of it. The display is bright and not too shabby. The phone can get a little laggy at times but I had no problems hooking up to various WiFi connections. Phone sound quality is pretty good. 4 out of the 5 people I call regularly said they could hear me perfectly. Has fm radio which I like. Works just like a big smart phone for the most part. Some apps don't work like Pinterest. I managed to get PokemonGo on there but, it wasn't very effective. However, Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, and Twitter worked very well. Small, but well. Netflix and Kindle worked....ok. Netflix was jerky and you can tell the phone struggles. It just barely misses the mark with processing power if you want to stream.Easy to root. Enough said.Once the novelty of a tiny phone wore off, I was left with a tiny phone. The only thing I couldn't stand was having to go back to T9. Unless you have little elvish fingers, you're SOL with typing on the full keyboard. You'll have to download a T9 keyboard to type and even then, it is annoying. I don't even have man hands and I was all over the place.I will be using this phone as a back up and when I go somewhere that I don't want to be lugging my Note4. You can put a lanyard on this little thing too! SAMSUNG, TAKE NOTE. For 33 bucks, this was a definite WIN. Oh, I also just popped my SIM card out of my regular phone and put it in this one with zero issues.",6.0

CNPGD Watch Cell Phone Mobile Touch Screen Mp3 Mp4 Fm Radio (Black/Silver),CNPGD,39.99,2,"kinda huge headache. Bought this for my best friend for Christmas since she has a job that won't allow her to have her phone at her desk but she is allowed things like smart watches, we wanted to be able to get ahold of her quickly if there was an emergancy at home. She opened it, played with it for about 20 minutes before the screen began to blink and stop responding to any touch on the screen or the button. Sent it back, at my own expense, and had a new one sent out. They did send an extra battery to sort of reimburse me for the shipping costs, which was good because the battery that was on the second watch when it got here exploded shortly after being turned on, but thankfully didn't damage the watch. The description for the item is a little unclear. This doesn't work WITH your smart phone, it IS a smart phone. It needs it's own sim card to be able to use all the functions, My friend almost had me send it back again because the touch screen isn't very sensitive at all. She says it will randomly stop responding to touch when used regularly. For the most part she doesn't really use it because of how frustrated she gets with it being glitchy all the time.",0.0

"BLU Jenny TV Unlocked T276T Cell Phone, Retail Packaging, Black Yellow",BLU,22.99,3,"This is a nice basic phone.On the PROS side, you'll find:- 2 line slots + 1 microSD slot- TV watching and FM listening (by the way, the phone has a deploying antenna, just like an old radio, my friends make a lot of fun of this feature)- Good GSM reception, speak and listening clarity.- Easy to use torchOn the CONS side, I'll list:- Very limited memory, the microSD is only useful to keep your pictures and music that can be transferred to and from your computer via the supplied USB cable.- You can only register one phone number by contact, forget about anything else like email, street address, notes, etc.- Very basic camera (1.3Mp with flash)- No MMS capability means you cannot send the pictures / videos you have taken.- No volume rocker makes it hard to control phone rings (only through settings), call or TV listening volume. Surprisingly, you may control the volume of the FM radio with both * (down) and # (up) buttons.- There is no way you can lock the keyboard, and when I put the phone in a pocket I may find that it was turned off (by pressing the ""hang up"" button for more than 2 seconds).Because all the drawbacks and limitations, I would normally have given only a one-star rating to this phone, but when I take the price paid into account, I can go up to a three-star rating.Nevertheless, I think BLU could have done a little effort in polishing this tool.",17.0

BLU Life 8 XL Smartphone - Unlocked - Global GSM - Pink,BLU,2000.0,5,"Let me start off by saying that I am incredibly hard on my devices and until now I have only had flagship devices. A little history of my phone usage; first phone ever iPhone 3gs otter box case, I went through three of these. I dropped 2 out of airplanes, and one got ran over after it fell from my pocket, next I had an iPhone 4s life proof case(not so much for me) I went through 2 of these one from water incursion after repeated drops broke the case and the second one fell out of a plane again, my third phone I went for a rugged option with with Galaxy s4 active with an otter box, I went through 2 of these, the screen overheated from constant use in the mid summer sun and the second one just croaked from what I'm sure is my own abusive nature. Now I started this off this way so that you know that I'm not some lightweight who barely used my phones, these things get used and mistreated in the harshest of conditions; water, snow, food prep, dirt, sweltering heat, sub zero temperatures.This is now my second blu phone on 2 weeks (the first one being an issue with an application that I needed to run that wouldn't run properly). Both phones are beautifully designed in my opinion and I personally don't desire anything else from them in the department. I have already dropped both devices with the silicon cases that came with them multiple times and I have only scuffed the screen protector. Without the battery, this device is very lightweight and took a little getting used to. The size is only a fraction of an inch smaller than the note 4. This slides perfectly in and out of my pocket. The screen quality is on par with my s4 if not better and the battery life is wonderful, I am still sitting on a charge from 24 hours ago with a full days heavy usage and 40 percent left. Coming from phones with lots of physical buttons to control the device, it was a little awkward to get used to only 3 buttons(volume up/down and power on/off).the camera takes pretty good pictures, it does however take a little while to focus on the object.The call quality is wonderful and the speed of the device is nothing short of great for me.the only thing had issues with has been not being able to receive certain messages with the stock application. This has been remedied by replacing it with an app from the App Store. The other thing that I have done is to put a launcher on the phone with help with ease of access. Everything that I wanted to work on this phone works beautifully. I was a little skeptical to purchase a blu device before my recent purchases. I can happily say though that I would happily recommend more products from blu mobile. The device that I though had issues(application support) was given to my mother to use, that's how much I trust these devices.Update: 2/20/16This device is out preforming my wildest dreams of what I thought I would experience. I have put this phone though the ringer and no issues. The speed of switching apps can lag a little bit with the CPU saving mode turned on, but with that off it's snappy. The screen is still crystal clear and I have gotten complement on it asking what type of device and ROM I have on it(LINE launcher is the only thing I have done to it) it's amazing. I have dropped it about a dozen times from about 5 foot to concrete and nothing has broken or scratched. The call quality is still great and my reception is wonderful. I work at a facility with horrible reception due to poor tower placement and massive concrete and steel structures and I have not had a dropped call or even the hint of any issues in my service. If this phone breaks by some chance, I will be purchasing another one exactly like it.",1.0

I ended up keeping my old phone but played with the G2 a bit more - and it is a disappointment overall. Software + hardware issues..not a great combo - LG you can do better I am sure! The screen is amazing to watch movies / pictures / browse and the battery life is pretty solid though. The vendor dealt with my issues swiftly though - appreciated it.Pros:* Gorgeous screen - if you can get your hands on 4K HD source it looks incredible. HD movies look also fantastic. This is one of the standout feature of the phone* Great camera* Good battery life (well, for a smartphone - I am still waiting for a smartphone that can last for 3 or 4 days straight)Cons:* BIG software issues: viber, whatsapp, facebook, any app that connects to the internet, are working on and off and wifi calling is often unavailable. the phone I received comes as an unlocked T-mobile phone with some T-mobile app that you cannot uninstall. Not a big deal in theory - but seems like the T-mobile settings get in the way of wifi calling* Other software issue - while in general the phone/android runs smoothly, once in a while the phones freezes / apps shut down / keyboard doesn't pops out when you want to type. Same things started on my Galaxy S2, after 3 years of use. Not right out of the box* SCREEN RESPONSIVENESS ISSUES. Every now and then the keyboard doesn't work. You type but nothing appears on the screen. My sister had a screen responsiveness issue with her LG G2 - the bottom home/back/switch buttons ended up not working after a while, while the rest of the screen was ok. Maybe a specific pb of LG phones? Is it a pb with the screen itself or the software I am not sure.* Power-button: I don't like the power button to be on the back of the phone - much easier if it is on the side. bit awkward to power on/off, especially as the phone has a large body. Same for the +/- sound buttons.",1.0

Not that I need the headphone but I just dont feel comfortable with this and feel it is repackaged somehow. So I ordered a replacement. And disappointingly it has the same issue+the phone is the box is flipped up-side-down. At this point the product just lose my trust.

BLU Life 8 XL Smartphone - Unlocked - Global GSM - Orange,BLU,149.83,1,"Horrible. Do not get this phone.When I first received the phone, it was a bit slow and the touch response wasn't the greatest. I almost sent it back and now... I really wish I had trusted my gut. A month or so after having the phone, the device got even slower. I'd click an app and it wouldn't even register the click until about five seconds after, then the app would take another ten seconds to load and then I'd have to wait an even longer amount of time before I click anything in the app or else it would freeze up. Also, I use the wifi almost all the time and it was rather annoying that whenever the phone went to sleep, it would kick the wifi off. Sometimes the wifi would reconnect after a minute or so of the phone being back on, but the majority of the time I have to go and reconnect the wifi... which is a huge issue because I would not be receiving my texts unless I was actively on the phone at all times. And yes, I had the settings set to keep the wifi on all the time (apparently it doesn't work).Now, about 3 months into having the phone, almost every single app crashes or freezes and I have to power off the phone. Also, the phone will go to black screen and will not respond to anything other than a power off. I've tried doing a factory reset and that accomplished nothing.Do not buy this phone.

Blu LIFE 8 Unlocked (Orange),BLU,169.99,1,"UPDATE:Don't buy this crap. A month after my 6 month warranty expired: - My wife's stopped charging. Touch screen randomly throws a fit and freaks out. - Mine, the speakerphone is completely dead/blew in it. Touchscreen issues as well.----------------My wife purchased the pink Blu Life 8 for herself about a week ago, after smashing her Samsung accidentally. She did about a full days worth of looking through different phones, and all the the different Blu brand phones (5.5, 6, 7, and 8) and she decided to spend the extra bucks for the 8. I work in IT and I was really impressed with the 8-core processor, and screen size for the price. It lacks the RAM of the super-high end phone but it sounded like a great amount of processing power. I was a little worried about battery life, but it's what she wanted and seemed reasonable enough.She received it and has been ecstatic with it so far. We had a little weirdness with the wifi initially. For some reason the OS kept setting itself to use a Static IP, instead of using DHCP, and this would have probably been a major deal if I wasn't in the IT field, but none the less I worked it out in about 60 seconds of fiddling with the networking settings, and it honestly could have been accidental on either of our part and not any fault of the phone. No issues with that since.As I mentioned previously I was a little worried about battery life having a large screen and an 8-core processor, but my wife claims that she only has to charge it once a day and is a heavy user, so I know I'll have no problems.The home/menu/back buttons on the bottom are very tiny compared to the space available. I'm not sure why, they could be bigger. But this is the main concern I've had with the phone when using my wife's. My wife doesn't have the problem as much as me, but they are simply very small, and because of the ""lip"" at the bottom (which will be the color you buy), a little awkwardly positioned versus other phones -- so it will take getting used to.The dual-sim capability isn't terribly useful for pretty much anyone in the US, but it is there none the less. It was hard tracking down the correct SIM card to work in this since I couldn't find what size it took. So for reference, it has two SIM slots -- one slot accepts standard size, and the other accepts mini-SIM. It does not accept nano SIM, but this wasn't a problem for us, I've never even seen a nano-SIM from any US provider.It is a little frail -- I worry about breaking it, compared to my 1/2"" thick rock solid cheap-o I have now, this thing feels very brittle as if it could bend or break easily, and cases are hard / next to impossible to find. Luckily, the shop I work for we cut-to-size tempered glass, so I'm going to put some tempered glass on both of ours to try to make them last.This all sounds negative, but it's only because other than these minor issues -- the phone is PERFECT! Even if the price was 50% more, I would still say it was a fair deal. I have been using a $20.00 Bunk Android phone for the past few months, and loved my wife's Blu Life 8 so much I just went ahead and purchased the Orange one for myself! I can't wait. Why the Yellow is $100 more, I don't know, -- I wanted the yellow -- but I just got the orange one instead. Honestly for the price, as a hetro manly man, I would have gladly purchased a bright pink one with ponies and faires and proudly showed off my new phone to peers. It's that good.Overall:PROS: - Price price price. This is a crazy cheap phone, and I got both of them within 2 days through Amazon Prime. A few years ago I was oogling over $700 quad-core processors, and here is an octo-core (8-core) for well under $200.00. I feel like this is comparable to $500-$600 phones easily. My wife is using StraightTalk with her's currently, and I will be using Net10 when mine arrives. When both of our plans run out, I will be switching us to Net10's Family Plan which is only $75 a month for both. - With the octacore processor, it's crazy responsive. I can move through apps, menus effortlessly, and without delay. My wife can play higher-end games that she couldn't previously play without lag. - Even the sound is much higher quality. The internal speaker is of outstanding quality -- loud but not distorted -- nothing we expected or are particularly picky about, but now that she has it, I don't think my wife could go back. I use speakerphone a lot and is one of the reasons I didn't hesitate to buy myself one. She loves it for music -- it's good enough to casually listen to music in a quasi-noisy room. - Battery life is up to par with older, larger phones. It's not the absolute best, but isn't bad. - The dual sim is pretty neat. Once again, we don't have much use for it, but I am switching providers soon and imagine it will be useful while dealing with that (see my comments about SIM size, however). - Screen is really nice. You can tell it's not as high of a resolution than it probably should be at that size -- things appear ""bigger"" instead of ""sharper"", but overall still quality.CONS - It's a little fragile looking and very thin. I'm terrified she is existantgoing stick it in her back pocket, sit, and bend it. The one from amazon did come with a very cheap plastic case which helps though. - Cases are basically non existent / hard to find. Maybe another Blu phone's cases is compatible with this one, and if that's so I would love to know, but there is only 3 cases absolute total I've found specifically for a Blu Life 8 - You can blame it on both the manufacturer and Amazon, but I could not find the SIM sizes anywhere so just had to hope that our SIMs would fit. There are three SIM sizes: Standard, Micro, and Regular. This phone will accept Standard and Micro -- not nano. You can tell Standard and Micro, as they both will have a little bit of cardboard around the metallic chip, Nano SIMs, which this phone will not accept, has absolutely no cardboard around the metallic chip. - The back/home/menu buttons at the bottom are kind of small, and awkwardly positioned. The ""lip"" below it will throw you off when switching to it from a new phone. As only my wife has used this phone day to day -- every time I use it I either ""miss"" the button entirely s or end up touching the screen instead at least once, meaning to press the back button (far right). I really wish I could make the phone keep them illuminated at all times. - 1GB of ram is a little small, and honestly the only thing that separates this phone from high end phones such as the Galaxy S5 is a slightly smaller screen and these phones have 2GB of RAM instead of only 1GB, however my wife and I both use our phones heavily, and we haven't had any issues.Overall however, I would give this phone an easy 9/10 overall, and surely a 10/10 for the price!",5.0

Camera is great (comes with filters, for you shutter bugs), and it has some nifty live wallpapers.And this has nothing to do with performance, but it comes with some really nice preloaded ringtones and alert tones. Usually I download all my own ringtones right away because the selection is awful, but some of the ones that come with it are actually really cool.Sipping was fast (three days with standard shipping!), getting it ready was a breeze, and now I'm telling everyone I know they have to get this amazing phone for only $100.EDIT: Six months on and this is still the best phone I've ever used. Haven't had any problems so far. The internet slowed down just a tad after I downloaded a few games, but it's barely noticeable. I also downloaded a new calendar, because the one that comes on the phone is really basic. But I'm still happy and I basically live on this phone.ONE THING: And this has nothing to do with the phone itself--the plastic case that comes with it becomes pretty rigid after about six months, and it gets hard to push the buttons through the plastic.

Motorola Moto G LTE- Factory Unlocked US Warranty (Black),,108.0,5,"First and foremost, this phone isn't a powerhouse. There isn't a single spec this phone has that isn't trumped by pretty much every major phone out there. That being said, if you want a smaller phone or even just a GREAT phone for the price, this may be the perfect phone for you.If you are coming from any modern flagship phone then the first thing you'll notice about this phone is it's size. 4.5 inches isn't a lot of phone anymore and is almost impossible to find outside the bargin-bin devices that makeup the prepaid lineup for most carriers, most of which are junk. For people with small hands (or small pockets) then this may be the ideal size to use. You won't be inviting friends over to watch the game on this phone, but short youtube videos are no problem.The button placement on this phone is decidedly budget. Both the volume and power keys are on the right side of the device and so that can take some getting used to, but both are easily adjusted too. It's a bit of a shame that there aren't dedicated home, back, and menu keys on this phone so we could use all the available screen real-estate (the Moto G uses software buttons), but more and more devices go this route so I can't really fault Motorola.The screen is very nice with good viewing angles and the colors really pop, especially when compared to other phones in this price range. It works well for reading or watching videos and the small screen really makes 720p look sharp.The camera is below-average, and especially in low-light this phone struggles to give nice images. They work in a pinch (especially in good lighting), but this is definitely an area where the budget price shows.The performance is more than adequate. When phones nowadays have more power than most people will ever use, this phone brings in just enough tech that you should be able to do anything the newest phones can do. All games and benchmarks play without a hitch, but some intense apps like high-end emulators (mainly PPSSPP) may not run as smoothly as the newest phones. Since this is such a specialized circumstance (and since even the highest-end phones can have issues on the same applications) I don't count it as a loss.Voice calls sound just as they should with the sound being clear on both sides of the call. VoLTE does make a difference if your carrier supports it.The battery is surprisingly generous, especially considering an average sized ~2000mah battery. A full-days use should be easy for most people, but heavier gamers may be reaching for a charger before the end of the day.This is probably the most ""average"" phone I've ever used, but the best part about it is how quickly the updates to the OS come. Expect this phone to be current for at least the next 1-2 major updates, more than most ""flagship"" phones can hope for. For the price this is the best phone you can get bar-none. You can save a bit if you don't want LTE and I do wish there was a 16GB option on this model, but this is the best definition of bang-for-the-buck.",1.0

CNPGD All-in-1 Watch Cell Phone & Smart Watch Sync to Android IOS Smart Phone (Black Plus),CNPGD,59.99,2,"I don't think I've ever received and decided to return a product so quickly.I'm a biker who just upgraded to a phablet, which is cumbersome beyond reason to carry on the bike. An mp3 watch seems like the perfect solution (yes, an mp3 player might be simpler. However I don't always have pockets, I hate arm bands, and I hate clipping things to my clothing. I know, first world problems). An option for communicating in case of emergencies might also be nice, so an mp3 watch it is. So all I'm really looking for is an mp3 player that's easy to wear, with a time function and possibly texting in a pinch, not a device to be my new best friend.I first tried a GT08, which seemed to work nicely but it bothered me when I noticed I had paid twice as much as I should have (the problem with these Chinese knock-offs is the same product is available from different sellers at vastly different price points). Plus I really disliked the ""nucleus"" menu style, so thought I'd try a different model.There was a lot to like about the CNPGD. Right out of the box, the silver metal finish looks very high quality and the band is much nicer than the GT08, very supple and comfortable. The menus are much cleaner and easier to navigate, having only 4 rather than 8 (mostly useless) options per screen. It let me transfer all my music into the required ""my music"" folder (something I suspect all these watches have in common to use the music player from your SD card) via PC, much more painless than the GT08 that made me hand select each song from the watch screen individually to move (note: I had to reboot the watch for it to find them, a minor inconvenience since the boot sequence is very quick).However, the love affair ended instantly when I realized to my dismay there was no shuffle option to be found anywhere for the player. I really wish if this isn't to be a standard feature that it would be mentioned in the item description. Who wants to listen to their playlist straight through in alphabetical order? Stupidest omission on an mp3 player ever.Another maybe not so small complaint is there seems to be no way to change the truly ugly watch face -- tapping the screen (which the GT08 required) did nothing, and I couldn't find any theme settings anywhere (not like there are a ton of places to look).So the search continues. Thank goodness for Amazon's painless return process, however I'm now out $12 in return shipping fees. If my third attempt is a bust, I may have to start considering something in a much higher price range (although from what reviews I've read on a few products, that's not necessarily a guarantee of quality either).",1.0

LG Neon GT365 Prepaid GoPhone (AT&T),LG,69.99,4,"Back in the days of unlimited data plans, I used to use a cellular modem as my only internet connection. When I ceased doing so I greatly missed the freedom of ""internet practically anywhere""; where I live hotspots are few and far between. However, there was _no way_ I was going to pony up $60 each and every month for five gigs that I'd only rarely use, and then have to pay huge penalties when I _did_ want to exceed it. While I still curse at the cost per gig and resent that there's no rollover, now at least I can buy however much or little service I want whenever I want it instead of paying an ungodly $60/month for a limited amount of data that can't replace my DSL.The coverage area seems good so far and I had no difficulty with installation on an XP netbook and net-top. The speed is best described as adequate, though I've had serious trouble whenever attempting to stream Netflix.Perfect, no. But livable, until something better comes along. My primary suggestion to the manufacturer is to go to a ""mifi"" type wireless interface instead of the USB stick so I could use it with an iPhone, etc. I'd have paid more for that ability.",0.0

Ofeely Bamboo Wood Charging Stand with 3 USB Ports for Apple Watch / iphone,Ofeely,16.99,2,The concept behind this is great but design wasn't fully thought out.. Cable for the Apple Watch is a bit to firm to fit in its designed in pocket so line sticks up or if forced down doesn't allow the Apple Watch charger to sit correctly and sticks out.. The USB port though looks nice is very weak.. Great for your phone not for a iPad even if you plug the USB to a higher powered ipad outlet.. iPad would take around 16 hrs for a full charge.. The under pocket to hide the iPhone wire also doesn't allow the line to hide in completely unless your wrap your wire very tight ( not good ) the remedy to that would be to get the shortest iPhone wire from Apple... Here are the facts... I gave it 2 stars only bc it is nice but to get to work correctly you would need another very short iPhone wire ( an added expense ) and you would maybe have to glue your apple charger to the docks so the wire sits in its spot and the actual charging spot doesn't rotate on you.. Things to consider to have this completely functional,

The service I was with was getting too expensive for what we actually use. Still not sure why it's so high but that's another story.Picked this up after looking at a few phones and reading a bunch of reviews. Right now it's my phone, but I think that will change shortly. The one thing that's noticeable is that it gets bogged down when memory gets low. I use Trend Security,Advanced Task Manager and Call Control. That eats up a lot of memory. If I open a few other things I have to go into the task manager and kill them or the phone will start taking small breaks. Just long enough to be disconcerting, and cause you to wonder if they phone locked up. Then it will respond again. If I remember to clean up the background tasks it doesn't seem to happen, so I'm pretty sure it's running low on memory (that part I know), and suspect it's paging out to flash. We're replacing all the phones, and others in a ""framily"" don't use the phone the ways I do... so one of them will be getting this, and I think I'll move over to the Blu Like One X, which has 2GB of RAM instead of 1GB. That should ease me memory issues up.I was surprised how good the screen looks for being as low res (540x960) as it is. Another plus is that Blu includes a case for the back and sides and a screen protector. That's appreciated considering I haven't seen either from other sources.Battery life has been pretty good.

TBS3203 Real GPS Tracker Kids Wrist Watch Phone for Children Safe Security SOS Surveillance SMS Position Watch,Turbosight LLD,189.99,1,"Everything set up as required. I have the watch with the numbers around the edge. I'm trying to set it up as an additional line to my TMobile account. Everything went normally from the TMobile setup perspective. SIM card was really mushy to insert but eventually 'clicked' and seemed stable. Observations so far:-- when it charges, the red light comes on as advertised, but the green light never does (blue ones do, though - and seems charged after several hours)-- whenever I turn the watch on, I get: ""Self check normal, entering standby mode, please check 'SM' card."" This combination of comments never appear as a possible combination in the documentation.-- using the smallest hole still allows the thing to spin like a top on my 8 year old's wrist. Once I determine that I won't be returning it, I guess I'll make an additional hole.I'm not able to get anything to work, although it does report ""GPS Normal"" when I go outside with it. Other than that, I can't communicate with any of the text messages, nor can a dial a number (it says ""calling"" then immediately goes to standby mode and the call doesn't complete.)After having become a PhD level student of all the comments here (thanks) - I'm pretty confident I'm doing everything correctly procedurally. Next stop is to do whatever I can to determine if the SIM card is bad or somehow incompatible. For the record, I am using this one:T-Mobile Prepaid Complete SIM Starter Kit - No Contract Network Connection (Universal: Standard, Mirco, Nano SIM)I'll report back if/when I can determine the status of the SIM card.Update: The SIM card checked out in every respect.

"Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679",Samsung,119.99,1,"I normally don't write reviews, but this phone is so horrible I must. I was led astray by the various glowing reviews I had seen here, and needed to replace my horrible Motorola Defy, and this seemed like the perfect fit. Unfortunately, this new phone is almost worst than the Defy was. It freezes ALL THE TIME, and like some of the other reviews have pointed out, is horribly unresponsive. I thought mine was defective, but after reading some of the recent reviews, realize that all the screens must be bad. The texting IS horrible, and lags so much. Not only that, but the back button sometimes doesn't take you to the main messaging screen, it takes you to another chat window with another person! Push back again, and another person! I get so frustrated texting, and sometimes, to text once, it'll take a good minute or so JUST to get to the text box. Ridiculous. I also have to constantly take out my battery because the phone keeps freezing. Just now, it wouldn't even let me take a phone call! Phone kept ringing like it was possessed, but only a blank screen. Sometimes, I just feel like throwing it against the wall and smashing it to pieces, it frustrates me so much. This phone deserves ZERO stars. Be a smart consumer and STAY AWAY. I sure wish I had.",12.0

"BLU Studio Mini LTE with 4.5-Inch IPS Display, 5MP Camera, Android Jellybean v4.3 and 4G LTE HSPA+ Unlocked Cell Phone - Retail Packaging - Pink",BLU,94.99,1,"I got this phone in Dec 2014. After about a week, I noticed a light spot develop on the screen, about an inch from the top and just left of center. I contacted blue and sent my phone in. About 4 weeks later, I got the phone back, the problem not fixed and no explanation. Called again, sent the phone back, 4 weeks later I get the phone back, fixed. After about a week, the phone developed the bright spot again. Called again and they said they would send me a new phone since this was the third time. They sent my old phone back, problem not corrected. Finally got their attention and had to send my phone in yet again. This time they sent me a new phone. After a few days, the new phone developed the bright spot. I think this is a design flaw. Look at your blu mini lte and see if you have a bright spot on light colored backgrounds, about an inch from the top. I am so sick of dealing with blu on this. I have never seen another phone with this issue. I wish I could give a true eval of this, but I've hardly used it in the 7 months Ive had it. They did upgrade to kitkat.",2.0

BLU Life 8 XL Smartphone - Unlocked - Global GSM - Orange,BLU,149.83,5,"Let me start off by saying that I am incredibly hard on my devices and until now I have only had flagship devices. A little history of my phone usage; first phone ever iPhone 3gs otter box case, I went through three of these. I dropped 2 out of airplanes, and one got ran over after it fell from my pocket, next I had an iPhone 4s life proof case(not so much for me) I went through 2 of these one from water incursion after repeated drops broke the case and the second one fell out of a plane again, my third phone I went for a rugged option with with Galaxy s4 active with an otter box, I went through 2 of these, the screen overheated from constant use in the mid summer sun and the second one just croaked from what I'm sure is my own abusive nature. Now I started this off this way so that you know that I'm not some lightweight who barely used my phones, these things get used and mistreated in the harshest of conditions; water, snow, food prep, dirt, sweltering heat, sub zero temperatures.This is now my second blu phone on 2 weeks (the first one being an issue with an application that I needed to run that wouldn't run properly). Both phones are beautifully designed in my opinion and I personally don't desire anything else from them in the department. I have already dropped both devices with the silicon cases that came with them multiple times and I have only scuffed the screen protector. Without the battery, this device is very lightweight and took a little getting used to. The size is only a fraction of an inch smaller than the note 4. This slides perfectly in and out of my pocket. The screen quality is on par with my s4 if not better and the battery life is wonderful, I am still sitting on a charge from 24 hours ago with a full days heavy usage and 40 percent left. Coming from phones with lots of physical buttons to control the device, it was a little awkward to get used to only 3 buttons(volume up/down and power on/off).the camera takes pretty good pictures, it does however take a little while to focus on the object.The call quality is wonderful and the speed of the device is nothing short of great for me.the only thing had issues with has been not being able to receive certain messages with the stock application. This has been remedied by replacing it with an app from the App Store. The other thing that I have done is to put a launcher on the phone with help with ease of access. Everything that I wanted to work on this phone works beautifully. I was a little skeptical to purchase a blu device before my recent purchases. I can happily say though that I would happily recommend more products from blu mobile. The device that I though had issues(application support) was given to my mother to use, that's how much I trust these devices.Update: 2/20/16This device is out preforming my wildest dreams of what I thought I would experience. I have put this phone though the ringer and no issues. The speed of switching apps can lag a little bit with the CPU saving mode turned on, but with that off it's snappy. The screen is still crystal clear and I have gotten complement on it asking what type of device and ROM I have on it(LINE launcher is the only thing I have done to it) it's amazing. I have dropped it about a dozen times from about 5 foot to concrete and nothing has broken or scratched. The call quality is still great and my reception is wonderful. I work at a facility with horrible reception due to poor tower placement and massive concrete and steel structures and I have not had a dropped call or even the hint of any issues in my service. If this phone breaks by some chance, I will be purchasing another one exactly like it.",1.0

Samsung Galaxy S6 SM-G920T Gold 32GB T-Mobile,Samsung,449.0,5,"I've previously owned the Galaxy s3 for 2 years and I decided it was time for an upgrade. I bought this phone Refurbished and the phone came in brand new! sealed and in its original package with the charger and ear buds and SIM tool. I'm a full-time student and part-time worker so i most of the time keep my phone on Ultra power saving mode during class and work and when i get home 4 pm I still have 50% of battery or more. The Phone is definitely an upgrade for me. this phone is twice the generation of my previous phone. Whether or not you need this phone and is worth the cost is up to you. Camera is amazing, very sharp those 16 mega pixels don't disappoint. Fingerprint sensor recognizes your finger pretty easily,never had an issue with it. I also love how fast it is when you press the home button twice to open the camera it literally takes a second or less. Also i hope you take care of your phones because this phone has a glass back with a camera protruding out of it so be careful. I recommend getting a case ASAP. Although you can take care of your phone no problem it's still good to have a case just in (case)lol you might drop it one day since it is a slippery phone. Display is very crisp and beautiful. Also to help you fix that little problem with the button lights for the galaxy s6 next to the home button. Get the app called Galaxy button lights to control that feature because the settings do not include that option to change the duration of the lights or to turn them off permanently. - K bye!",12.0

"ASUS ZenFone 3 Laser 5.5"" 2GB RAM 32GB storage, Dual SIM - Factory Unlocked Phone - Glacier Silver",Asus,199.0,5,"This is a review for the Asus Zenfone Laser 5.5 2 gig version. After checking reviews and questions answered I decided to try this phone out. In simple terms this is a remarkable phone. It is fast, highly responsive and i haven't noticed a single lag. So I will outline basically the various aspects of the phone briefly.BuildIt feels premium, and looks premium. It is light and very thin and thus I sometimes forget it is in my pocket. I haven't noticed any heating problems. The finger print sensor is easy to set up and is extremely fast and works how they said it would work. I took selfies tapping it flawlessly. Where the size makes it difficult for one handed use the software and the well placed buttons compensate.The screen is beautiful and it makes everything look a little bit nicer.With 2 gigs of ram and 32 gig of storage I have played games I otherwise would not have tried to play on a smart phone. N.O.V.A 3 plays without any lag and so does zombie reaper. So this is a safe device for playing action games keeping in mind the 2 gigs of ram.CameraThis is fast and snappy and the laser autofocus works as it should. I only had a few instances of blurred pics but that was when doing other things and switching back in low light setting. The pictures are beautiful and thought they may not be dslr standards, they are pretty good. The front and back camera take pictures of very good quality.SoftwareSome reviewers on youtube were griping about software but I actually rate the zenUI above samsungs touchwiz because of the amount of control it allows. Yes there are other apps aka bloatware but most have been useful in managing the phone and its systems and is way less intrusive that some similar and popular apps that would be downloaded in the googel store. It comes with built in app lock and a place to hide sensitive files. You can record calls without needing a separate app. In all I have found I hadn't the need to download most of my usual apps. The theme feature is a plus and you can even alter how you scroll though your homepage and how the apps are ordered. It is a Software that allows you to totally make your phone your own.FM RadioIt has a built in FM Radio that works very well.BatteryI would rate the battery as 4 out of 5. It lasts for the entire day with relatively heavy usage but based on what mode you put it in, it could last much longer.Speakers and Call qualityThe speakers are high but since they are mono speakers they obviously won't be as high as phones with dual speakers. The call quality was excellent and I had no trouble with the phone accepting my gsm sim or memory card.In Summary this is an awesome phone thus far and when using it you would think you have a phone that is much more expensive. I believe this is an excellent bang for your buck.",7.0
Pandaoo Smart Watch Mobile Phone DZ09 Unlocked Universal GSM Bluetooth 4.0 Music Player Camera Calendar Stopwatch Sync with Android Smartphones(Silver),Pandaoo,69.99,3,"The old saw goes that you get what you pay for and it could not be more true than in the case of this ubiquitous ""smartwatch"". This device ,the DZ09, is sold on Amazon alone by at least a dozen (maybe more) different sellers using as many different brand names.In fact it will do much of what it says and possibly all if you are more aware of your surroundings than I was. In particular I was looking for a smartwatch that also was capable of making direct phone calls via a SIM card. You can imagine my disappointment when I removed my Micro SIM card from my AT&T phone and slipped it into this watch, turned the watch back on and it still said ""Insert Sim"" on the screen. I went back into my order details and discovered that there was a notation there that the device is a 2G device and that after Jan 1 2017 only T-Mobile will be offering 2G service. Apparently AT&T has already discontinued their 2G service which is why my SIM wouldn't work in it.Aside from that the watch does pretty much what it says it will although there are a number of the built in ""apps"" such as Facebook, Whatsapp and others that only work when a SIM card in inserted. It kept good time, and was easy to pair with my Note 3 and could answer and make calls through the BT interface. The camera is a little chintzy compared to the one I had on my Samsung Gear SM V700 but then I didn't expect much from it and got what I expected.Because of the ability to make and answer calls, control the audio playback of my phone and display incoming texts and notifications it was more useful than my Martian Notifier watch. For $20 it was not a bad investment and for someone wanting to find out if they are cut out for a smartwatch without a major expenditureI would say go for it. I have in the meantime invested a few bucks in a new battery for the SM V700 and a toolkit to install it with and this will be my backup in case that operation doesn't turn out so well.",2.0

I found out the hard way that its 4G frequency bands are not compatible with several other carriers. For example, the item description says it will work with T-Mobile, and sure, it will if you never want to use data, since its frequency bands for 3G and up are not compatible with T-Mobile or any small carrier that piggybacks off of T-Mobile. I initially thought I did my homework here, but ended up having to return it because my small provider uses T-Mobile's network and I could not get anything better than 2G which is laughable. So, I repeat: be VERY careful about data compatibility with anyone who's not AT&T!",1.0

Plum Ram - Unlocked Rugged Phone - Tough Durable IP67 - Water Shock Proof GSM (Orange),Plum,49.99,3,"I think i remember this had 3 stars when I bought it. It had everything I wanted and nothing I didn't need. I haven't been able to figure out how to activate predictive texting, but on the phone I had before the last one, I didn't use predictive text either, so it isn't so bad, but a mild inconvenience. The buttons click, which makes texting sound like I'm a cockroach eating a cracker, but I figure that's not a big deal either.It is surprisingly lightweight, and extremely sturdy for as light as it is. It has grommets all over the place to seal every crevice from water leakage. I have never really worried about water before with a phone, but this one I'd be more worried about it getting flushed down the toilet than falling in (as one of my past phones did). It is slightly bigger than my samsung gravity 2. I haven't been able to transfer pictures or games from my last phone, but I don't have a mini sd card either. It is unlocked and has 2 sim card slots, and it constantly reminds me that the 2nd sim card slot is empty. I don't need a 2nd phone number, so I don't have two sim cards. It comes with one game that is a puzzle game I've quite enjoyed. I don't see any avenues to download other games to it, which is kind of sad, but I am still trying to figure the phone out. It may be that a more tech savvy person could figure out how to do what I would like to be able to do, but I can't. It is not quite the step up from my last phone that I was expecting, but it isn't too much of a step down, plus the price is half of what I paid for my gravity 2 five years ago. No need for a case... handles talk and text...so yeah, 3 stars. It's okay, not great, or even all that good, but not bad, and not too inconvenient, best of all, not expensive. So 3 stars it is.",9.0

Like autodim gone wild. I cant get it back but have to hard boot it. Its not a feature you can turn off. I bought my Life View in mid-October 2013. 1st one didnt work right out of the box. :( <sigh> Hope i do not get this much trouble for a replacement on the second one. Amazon.com took care of replacing the first one.Whats the deal with the lack of storage on the phone. I barely have any apps and I am always out of storage. Everything possible has been moved to phone storage from internal storage and still I cannot load any apps due to lack of space.Biggest problem though is the screen. My screen goes black but it is still responsive to touch. If i touch the right areas of the screen, i can answer phone calls, listen to music, all text people by accident. But no matter what i do, i can see the screen. Its black as night. music can be blaring, volume buttons on side of phone work but no screen to know what im doing or touching. It ticks me off. I have to hard boot the phone. Argh.",5.0

The software however is bit buggy for Vista-64 but works fine with XP. I spent a day setting up the N95. Once working, it's a small wonder. I also have an iPhone and the Nokia has far more features and is a better phone, esp. it's unlocked so that I can use it overseas - this restriction on the iPhone is the worst thing to an otherwise a great device of its kind.

I had an older Windows phone and just popped the SIM in and everything worked fine.If you buy one of these, make sure you go through the process of updating to Windows Phone 8.1. It takes multiple updates to get to 8.1, but it's worth it.Otherwise the phone is very nice. As others have noted, it's heavy, but that doesn't bother me.

"Premium (2-Pack) Bluetooth Selfie Stick & Wired Selfie Stick Extendable with Built in Remote and Adjustable Phone Holder the Best Self-Portrait Monopod for iPhone, Samsung Galaxy & Android Phones",AMM Global Enterprises,29.99,5,"We received the two selfie sticks (one wired, the other bluetooth) in a timely fashion. However, the wired one did not work at all--no matter how many times we checked the connection on different phones. In their routine e-mail to customers, the seller contacted us to inquire as to whether we were happy with the purchase. I noted no, of course. The seller then sent us a new wired selfie stick and it works perfectly. The seller was willing to spend time on e-mail exchanges and cheerfully agreed to replace the defective wired selfie stick. Such customer service alone is why I'm giving the product 5 stars. Regarding the two selfie sticks themselves: they work very well. The only thing I might recommend is that any purchaser spread a very, very thin layer of petroleum jelly on the telescopic metal extension boom to make the sliding action a bit easier. All in all, great product.",0.0

It snapped back together. With a minor dent around the edge. No screen damage. I bought the phone again last year for 12$ to test custom recovery methods. And flashing custom Roms. It was fun.

""is there nothing you can do for me? You guys are my carrier now and this phone is only couple months old??"", I said. ""there is a Blackberry Curve re-certified for only $325."" Verizon replies. ""Ok I had that same phone on Virgin Mobile (VM) that I bought for 1/3 the cost you are charging, brand new and its only a 3G phone if I wanted that I would of stayed on VM and paid 1/3 of the bill also (plus your data is capped now), and did you say ONLY $325??."" ... Long story shortI then saw Virgin Mobile had Dual Core and 4G phones! Bye Verizon you can take your 78/month, 88/month, 98/month and finally 108/month?? The one thing you know is fact, your monthly will always go up with a contract. And if you don't have insurance on your phone you will be paying as much as a non-contract phone.I had VM for 8 years and left them for 4 months and learned a valuable lesson, there is no benefit to going with a contract carrier.

Very fast, works well on AT&T, operating system is snappy and intuitive - I'm more a fan of Windows Phone but Sony's version of Android Lollipop is solid. Battery life is good and better than phones I've had in the past - I do use fairly power-intensive apps though and need to charge it every 36 hours or so. Screen is bright and clear. The build quality feel of the phone is high. Audio quality is great on headphones, passable on speaker / phone calls, it could improve in this area. I'm glad it has front facing speakers, though haven't utilized them a great deal. One thing, I cracked the back glass within days because I thought I wouldn't need a case - I was wrong, just a small impact cracked it while it was inside my pocket. I recommend a TUDIA slim line case which also works great with a DEFF magnetic charger, Magnetic charging is awesome by the way, the next best thing to wireless, it puts less strain on the USB port and covers so probably helps it maintain waterproof status.

English is the universal language of the internet.The product is great. It's my first ""smartphone"" ever. I have big fingers, yet no problems with the keypad. I really like the keypad vs. touchscreen. Sending over 3 sentences on a touch screen is a pain in the ass. The Blackberry 9930 is one of the best choices for communicating online via messaging.#1 thing I've noticed: call voice clarity. Wow. It sounds like a land-line. The voice on the other end sounds as if I'm in a radio broadcast station, using high end audio equipment in an acoustically paneled room. This is likely one of the clearest and warm sounding phones on the market.The screen is extremely responsive. No lag whatsoever. Holds a charge very well (even with WiFi ""ON"").Still exploring the many uses this phone offers. It's a great triumph in human civilization to build such great devices.

I was aware of the limitations in terms of speed, however there seem to be a multitude of other problems. To start with the SOS feature cannot be configured. I logged onto GEOS as instructed and received a code - the code must be entered into the unit to enable the SOS feature - guess what the software does not allow you to enter it anywhere. The web browser feature doesn't not work and there are two conflicting sets of instructions one says to use the Safari browser the other says to use Opera mini - neither works. On the iPhone the connect button works, but it disabled on the IPad. Neither Twitter access method works - a Twitter PIN is required, but Twitter will not provide those to US residents. The Mail function can send email via gmail but seems unable to receive any email from gmail. In addition the unit is unable to hold a sat link for more than 2 or 3 minutes - even in open flat ground. No link can be made at all while moving. I have ordered aux antenna to see if that helps. The phone appears to work - but I doubt a signal lock can be held for more than a minute or two. Iridium and GEOS provide zero support and the online documents and APP help are a joke. The user is on their own to figure it out The unit appears well built and durable but it is nothing more than an overpriced paperwieght.

Sony Xperia Z5 E6653 3GB/32GB 23MP 5.2-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (WHITE) - International Stock No Warranty,,350.99,5,"Alright so after about a full month of using, I think I'm ready for a review now. First of all let me note that I use a E6683(Dual SIm) and its from Hong Kong. The first thing I will say is YES the LTE does work in the US, be it T-mobile or AT&T actually any GSM carrier will do.Screen• The screen is really sharp even though it's just a 1080p, thanks to it X-reality. However if you were to compare this to a Galaxy S6 or any smartphone with a AMOLED display, I would say the AMOLED does produce more vibrant color. Pixel vise I highly doubt anyone can tell the different unless you hold the very very close to your eyes (which of course, not a lot of people will do that). I do think that reading on the Z5 is more comfortable thoughSound• Sony has a lot of commercial regarding about their ""Hi-res"" music and ""Hi-res"" player and I think they are right. The stereo front speaker is nice since you will rarely block it but don't get your hope on it since its not really that loud. I mean you wouldn't want to use it as an entertain system with a lot of people anyway. Next the headphone, I've seen a lot of review saying the sound quality isn't as good as the other smartphone out there, in this case I will have to take a different ground. I own a Sony MDR-1ADAC and the sound is amazing when pair with the Z5. I tried compare with it Galaxy S6 and to me I feel like there is clearly different quality in music. On the down side, you are require to have a Hi-res music quality otherwise the quality isn't that . . . .Performance• ""SoC 810 does it overheat ?"" my answer is ""It really depend"" If you're recording a 4K video then yes it will definitely heat up but so does the other smartphone. Gaming vice I think the Z5 is doing fantastic, the Z5 can run any game so far that I tried smoothly. It does though lag sometime when it heats up (rarely, like 1% ) and has low battery mode is activate. It definitely run smoother than my HTC oneM9+ haha.• Now everyday uses such as email, texting, web surfing, all of these are buttery smooth. In fact I would say any flagship is the same in this area, unless you came from an IOS which is a lot heck smoother.Camera• That hybrid focus ! Yes it focus really fast BUT it take like a WHILE to processing the image. If you came from a Galaxy S6 or even from an Iphone 5 you will notice a substantial different in time. Iphone took a picture in like a blink of an eye, while S6 is a little slower than that but still in a blink of an eye. But for the Z5 its like 1-2 second on camera processing after picture was taken which can be huge deal if you really need to get that picture. I would say the Z5 is more like a digital camera since it be ""hit"" then done. The image quality though I would say the Z5 is better compare to the S6 or Iphone 6 but its not really a by a big margin though. Also if you really want to take a professional picture, then any smartphone wouldn't do as of now. Overall I wouldn't sacrifice the 1-2 second for a little better camera, but if you can live with that, then I would just say go ahead.• Front camera is okay but wouldn't say it's the best out there in the market compare to like a selfie centred phone. It does produce a satisfy result though.Software• If you like Stock-Android then you will probably like this too. It ran almost identical to stock android except with the small app. There's a bloatware but you can un-install it or just disable it. The finger print scanner on this phone is superb, its super and way more accurate than the Iphone 6 or even the S6 (at least to me).• This is for people who has a PS4 and want it to use for a remote play. It work technically but don't expect the same experience from the TV also a good internet connection is require to a smooth remote play too. Unless you want to connect you Z5 to a Lan cable, which work haha (I did that :D)• The battery on this phone is last longing, you can expect a whole day or more with this phone. The charging is quite slow to me though even with the Qualcomm quick charge 2.0 but maybe I was just used to a tiny battery of an Iphone 6 and S6.Phone• The phone also come with expandable storage which could give you an 32GB boost in less than $50• The water proof and dust proof thingy isn't really a big deal if you're always careful around with your phone• The strap hooker or whatever it call, to me is something I really miss. With this I can use the phone without fear of dropping, I can even take a photo without fear of dropping the phone into a river, jungle, mountain or so whatever you can name it.OverallThe phone is a premium phone if you ask me but does it worth the price, I wouldn't say it worth it to buy this phone as of now. The music quality on this phone is superb if you use a Hi-res audio and headphone. The camera is also really good but take about 1-2 second longer than the IPhone or S6 to process the image. Heating isn't something you have to worry anymore, as per gaming it will eventually heat up after a while of playing but so does every phone. Overall I would say this is a great phone, it would be perfect for me if the camera processing is at least as fast as the S6",17.0

HTC One M8 - Factory Unlocked 32GB - US Warranty (Glacial Silver),HTC,138.99,5,"I've been stuck with my old phone (HTC MyTouch 4G) since 2010 and have always held off from getting a new phone based on post-release reviews and I'm the sort who refuses to jump on the Apple bandwagon. When the time was nearing for the Sony Xperia Z2, Samsung S5, and HTC M8 spring release, I was in dilemma as far as which one would suit my needs. I decided to take a chance and buy this phone unlocked for both me and my girlfriend and we couldn't be any more happier with our decision because this phone is as every bit as good as any other leading mobile phone. I especially love how the audio speakers are placed in the front of the phone and the sound clarity is outstanding. Even now close to a month after owning this phone, the premium aluminum feel and look is pristine as when we first got it (but I highly recommend buying a case). Beyond any doubt, this phone has set the standard when the original 2013 version released only to raise the bar even further with this new model.",3.0
"Polaroid Snap S55WH 5.5"" Unlocked Phone Android 5.1, 4G LTE, Back & Front Flash",Polaroid,127.08,4,"The Polaroid Snap S55PK has a lot of awesome features at a price that won't break the bank. With that being said, this phone has it's ups and downs. Most of the downs can be corrected by following some simple steps. Below you will find some of my personal experiences with this phone and the steps I did to correct the small issues in the time that I have had it so far:The phone has 8GB of memory. Half of which is being utilized by the operating system. When you receive the phone it is going to have about 4GB of free space. If you want to get the best out of this phone, it is recommended to purchase a micro sd card (not one of the fancy ones, just a simple micro sd card not to exceed 32GB). The tricky part is that right out of the box the phone does not have the capability to save files to the memory card.I had to navigate to settings - about phone - system update and run 2 updates on the phone. After the 2nd update (dated 4/20/2016) applied to the phone, I was then able to set the phone to write to the sd card instead of the 4GB of space on the phone. One issue I have not been able to resolve, is that this setting allows for the newly installed applications to automatically save to the sd card, but this setting does not allow the pictures to automatically save to the sd card.In order to get the pictures to save to the sd card, you have to go into file management and locate the folder in which your pictures are saved. You would hold your finger down on one of the pictures which will make a drop down menu appear at the top. The drop down menu will have the option to 'select all'. After you select all, you will have the option to 'cut' or 'copy' the selected photos. Once you do this, you will want to immediately go back to the beginning of file management, locate or create a folder that you want to save the files to on your sd card and then paste them there. Keep in mind, if you select the 'copy' option instead of the 'cut' option, you are only placing a copy in the sd card and not actually clearing the space on your phone. If you are trying to clear the space on your phone, you will want the 'cut' option.Make sure you are using a phone charger that is compatible with this phone's ratings. I used a car charger with mine that I have had for quite some time and started receiving messages stating that the battery was overheating and I needed to remove the battery. The phone was really not to touch (not the battery, surprisingly enough) and took a while to cool down. I have not had this error prior to using that charger or since I used that charger, so I'm left to believe that the charger just isn't compatible. I have not read about this phone having battery issues or power issues, so here's to hoping that was just a one time fluke.I love the 5.5"" screen size, the bright and vivid screen/colors, the smoothness of the android 5.1 operating system. The phone is a really bright pink, so don't think you'll get by with buying this phone as a potential gift for your brother like I was thinking. I've decided I might have to keep this one for myself and invest in the blue one for him. ;-)I see one potential problem arising from the design of the phone and that's the camera lens. It isn't indented into the phone like most camera phones are. If you lay your phone down, the camera lens will be touching the surface of whatever you set it on which can easily get scuffed or break. I will have to keep this review updated with that information as more time passes.* I received this item at discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review*",1.0

Apple iPhone 5s 32GB (Gold) - T-Mobile,Apple,210.0,2,"First let me identify the seller ""Phone-Zone"". So many people complain about a seller, but they don't give the name.First the phone (IPhone 5s) took longer than normal to get here, but the weathers been bad, so ok. The real problem was that while everything stated by the seller and Amazon on the website, receipt and labeling, implied that the phone was new and T-Mobile ready, is now in doubt. I was unable to activate the phone with my carrier T-Mobile because the SIM was unusable or not installed. After some trouble I was able to get the SIM cover off, and there was a T-Mobile SIM installed. So the SIM is either defective or had been activated before. So no phone.I am driving the 30 miles to my local T-Mobile store tomorrow, to try and get the phone working, and to find out its history. I'm hoping they're good with IPhones, because while working over the phone with T-Mobile to resolve the problem, the SIM card became jammed in the IPhone (poor design). SO NO PHONE!When you spend the kind of money Apple asks for their products, you expect more. I've owned three Apple products, including this one, and had problems with two of the three. That's Not Good.Overall, I give the 5s just 2 stars and the seller Phone-Zone 0 stars.",5.0
Apple iPhone 4S 16GB (Black) - Verizon,Apple,224.77,4,"Since there are already a lot of reviews of the phone I'm going to focus on the experience of buying a refurbished one. The phone arrived in a used iPhone 4s box that had seen better days. Inside the box was a plastic tray with a single compartment containing the phone. The compartment was much larger than the phone, so the device was not actually secure in the packaging. Under the try I found the charger and a small booklet as expected. I buy a lot of refurbished electronics and it looks like in this case the seller may use the term refurbished a bit loosely based on the packaging. The phone was in good condition, but I had some trouble finding the ESN. It was on a label on the outside of the box and for some reason someone had placed another label over it making the numbers hard to read. Fortunately the ESN is available on an iPhone in the About screen on the phone. Activating was easy and this replaced my current phone rather than requiring a new line.The phone is in good condition and the battery seems fine. In retrospect, I saved a bit of money over buying from the manufacturer, but would probably feel a bit more comfortable about the device had I gone that route instead.",0.0

I have owned iphones, Samsung's Galaxy 4, and Moto X and Moto G recent iterations. They all have had their pluses and minus's and the Vivo 5 is no exception. This phone is remarkable in that Blu was able to deliver such a nice phone at this price point.This phone is for:1. Parents that have kids in need of a phone. Why pay $800 for a phones that performs marginally better.2. People on a budget. You won't ever feel like you are ""out of it"" with this phone.3. Business travelers who want a stylish unlocked travel phone, Just drop a new sim card in and go.4. People who really need a great battery. I went to work and used the phone half a dozen times (a moderate day for me) and came back home to 68% battery life!!!!! crazy to think I could realistically go two days between charges.Great for price point:32 GB of Memory3 GB of RAMFull Aluminum body. (liquid silver)USB C chargerSim tray-very solid feel and everything slid in very nicelyGood:Amoled display38,763 Antutu Benchmark out of the box13 MP camera. Good enough for the 80% of us that have a real camera for super important shots.Not so good:Having to format a 64 GB SD card with FAT32,It will throw some of Blu's customers. It took me less than 5 min to do it.Free advise to BLU:Support your products a little bit. Start a ""for profit division"" that develops some nicer cases and accessories for your better phones. For example: Sell 64GB SD cards formatted Fat32 for $20 on your site and make $10 on each one. Happy Customer, Happy Company!I activated this phone on a Red Pocket (AT&T network) annual plan. 1000 min phone, 1 Gig data per month (I'm always around Wi-Fi so why pay for it) and unlimited texts for $229 on eBay. That is $19 a month.Update 2-29: Hard to charge with case on. Need to flip up the corner or remove case for the charger to seat properly.Minor irritation but the weak link right now for BLU is great phones but very limited options for cases.",23.0

CNPGD [U.S. Warranty] All-in-1 Smartwatch and Watch Cell Phone Gold,CNPGD,49.99,4,"Super Cool Qaud Band Watch Touch Screen Cell Phone WhiteI chose 4 stars mainly because it didn't come the way it was advertised. On my 'Super Cool Quad Band Touch Screen Watch' it only had 6 icons on the screen instead of 9 like it's advertised, that being said...i guess i didn't get all the features advertised in the ad i saw. The ad i saw advertised internet, java games, mp3/4, fm, and more (i have the other features).When i got it i purchased a prepaid tmobile sim and micro sd card and it worked right away. When i got homme i loaded the sd card with music and that worked as well ( i think you have to load music to both phone and sd card for it to work). I charged my bluetooth and it connect right away. The camera and video camera works surprisingly well. The texting is okay, only because you have to use a tiny stylus, but i think the size would be perfect for a kid.(Side Note: I am not for young kids having cell phones, but this is DEFINITELY something i would give to my 12 and 9 years old kids! It's discreet enough that a school official wouldn't take it based on looks, it doesn't have games on it to distract them. It has just enough to keep them entertained, and you as a parent can contact them in case of an emergency!...talk, text, and mp3/4 with bluetooth accessibility.So...all that being said i'd recommend this product to the person that wants the freedom to take their phone anywhere without the feeling of lugging around a bulky phone, that may or may not want to use bluetooth, that enjoys music, and doesn't mind texting with a tiny stylus!Note: If I find anything else that i like or dislike i will definitely add to this post if possible or create another.

"Samsung Galaxy S5 SM-G900H Factory Unlocked Cellphone, International Version, Black",Samsung,339.99,4,"I love the look and feel of the phone. The front camera is splendid. The selfie camera shows a lot of detail as long as there's good lighting. The phone comes with a number of unique features most of which can be turned on or off so you can have a customized experience with the phone.My main complaint with this phone is the battery :/. If you're a heavy user (like me) you should always carry a charger with you and invest in a spare. The phone is prone to overheating when charging which is kinda scary. So do not do a lot of demanding tasks while it is charging and let it charge on a hard surface (cloth will make it heat up). Ever since the Android 5.0 update came out (which I have yet to download), the update notification refuses to go away and I'm not sure if that is what is effecting my battery life because when I bought the phone the battery life was decent.I really do love my S5, it has a lot of exclusive useful features and add-ons. It does have it's issues every now and then but I overall am liking my purchase.OVERVIEW:Biggest Pro: Camera(s), Exclusive add-ons and featuresBiggest Cons: Battery, Periodic Goofs",0.0

But who needs instructions? I just put those back in the box and turned the phone on. Well, turns out the phone itself is also in Korean. Apparently this phone was intended to be sold in Korea. No matter however. The first screen that pops up has a drop down box, just open it up and you'll be able to select your language. Oh, and the stock keyboard is also in Korean. You'll have to change the keyboard settings in 'Language and Input' in your system settings, and I would recommend replacing it with any third party keyboard from Google Play.I just popped in my SIM card and was up and running within minutes. Using the CyanogenMod installer ((Google it if you wish)) I had this thing running on CyanogenMod Android within the first hour after I opened the box. As great as the phone is already, running CyanogenMod will truly unlock this phones capabilities.The S Pen is one of the greatest things about this phone.

"BlackBerry Classic Factory Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BlackBerry,149.99,2," I've been using both iPhone and Samsung Galaxy for quite some time, I was recently using a Samsung Galaxy s4 when I thought of buying an iPhone and I was going to buy an iPhone 5 when by chance I found out about the Blackberry classic. I admit that since I saw it I fell in love and especially when I saw the physical keyboard, I knew I had to have it.I must clarify that before the iPhone and the Samsung Galaxy I was a Blackberry user, I was always a fan of its elegant design and its software, but after people changed the Blackberry Messenger by WhatsApp, and the fact that there barely existed some apps that didn't even ran so well in the Blackberry, that forced me to change to the aforementioned brands.The idea of ​​buying the Blackberry Classic was merely because it promises to be a cell phone that will optimize and make easier working with email and text messaging, FALSE!Recently, I had closed all my social networks and just wanted a cell phone to focus on email and text messages, but definitely this phone does not do the best work in those functions.First of all I can not believe how slow it is between applications (take note that i uninstalled LinkedIn, Facebook, Foursquare and Twitter, which are already installed when you buy it. I wonder how slow it would be if I had to use all these social networks!), it's ridiculous, sometimes BBM itself takes a few seconds to open a single message, and when using WhatsApp, there have been occasions where I have pressed the button to open the message and ends opening the user profile, all because of its slowness.Second, the design of the software generally feels somewhat out of date and responds slowly compared to any other phone on the market today (including some older as the q10 and Blackberry z10). What is unforgivable is the instability that this phone has, a total chaos to navigate between same Blackberry OS 10 options, I can't believe how this came out to the market.What's most surprising is the price, I paid a total of $ 485 (with taxes), and it's amazing that for half the price I could have bought a z30 which is much faster and stable than this!What most struck me was the physical keyboard, once I already had it in my hands felt cheap! I saw many reviews saying that the keyboard was comfortable and that it wasn't that noisy when you pressed a key, but the real thing is that every time I press a button at night, my neighbor ends up yelling at me to please stop texting in the phone.I would say the product is a complete disappointment and I dare to say that it's a scam for the price it has.My advice would be: by no means buy this phone, it is nothing that you expect it will be. For those who want to have a ""retro experience"" of those golden times of Blackberry and those long sessions with BBM chat I recommend to borrow it for a week and then return to something more modern (if only is to send and receive email).Do not be fooled with the idea that this phone is ideal for work, simply in no way is good. You will end up suffocated with its really pathetic and unjustified slowness.Another thing is that it can be use as a weapon thanks to its weight.I hope they make an update soon that optimize its OS.",8.0

BLU Studio C 5+5 Smartphone with Lollipop OS- US GSM Unlocked - Gold,BLU,249.99,3,"I bought two of these phones because I wanted to surprise my friends, who were going away on a trip and both of them needed new phones. I looked at many different smart phones on here, specifically with 4G LTE, which in itself narrows the selection. This phone stood out to me. The price seemed ok, the specs sounded fine and the reviews were encouraging. So I bought two. I was excited about getting them, and giving them away but the joy of the surprise didn't last very long. Both phones have inaccurate sensors. If I tap a letter in the top row, it gives me language selection. I need four, sometimes five attempts to open an app because it doesn't respond to lighter touch. It becomes extremely annoying when you type a message and it frequently inserts a suggestion, just because you typed the letter slightly upward. Even for a budget phone like this one, I expected better adjustment. I also couldn't, like in my own phone, (which was the same price but seems a much better quality) calibrate the sensor to have a more accurate typing experience. There was no way to fix this.As I gave the two phones away, the frustration was high as I felt I had made a bad choice. I am returning at least one of them and have already ordered a phone of which I know that it works.There is some good about these phones however. The wifi is relatively fast and the phone itself is fast in opening apps for example. The screen is very clear and almost looks like a retina screen, very high quality. The colors are vibrant. This phone comes with a screen protector and a slim silicone case. All of that is absolutely great and I like that the sellers do sell a product with thought behind it. But all the good doesn't help if the one thing that makes a phone useable, being able to type or press on a symbol is not working well.",1.0

JUNING 7-Inch Dual Sim Android 4.4 Smartphone - Black,JUNING,,4,"A great cellphone with the size of a tablet. This is a great phone with all the extras as the other name brands has, but of course we cannot compare name brands to Junning brand, as they are cater to people that are wanting to have a very nice smartphone for an affordable price. There are lots of great other things to this phone, as this is a 3G phone, with dual sim card slot, and unlocked, which means i can use this phone whatever country i am in without removing my personal sim card. Another great thing about this phone is the size, 7inch screen is quite big for a phone, so this can also use as a tablet, i can get on with my online stuff just like a regular laptop or desktop. This also is best for playing games for myself or for the kids. Since kids love to use tablet to play some games or educational activity, this would be a great and affordable gadget to give to them. This works fast too, and i am happy with it. One thing that made me concern about this phone is the camera, it was a little blurry, if the company would change the camera resolution higher, this would be a super great phone.*** I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and all opinions are my own",3.0

Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 I9200 8GB Unlocked GSM Dual-Core Android Smartphone w/ 8 MP Camera - Black,,249.99,5,"When I first open the box I said to my self this is a very large phone, but after using it for an hour or two you get used to its size. I have a Samsung galaxy note 3 which is 5.7 inches and people say its a large phone but when put beside the Samsung galaxy mega 6.3 which is 6.3 inches it makes the note 3 look like a iPhone. It has a lot more screen real estate which is good for a types of media, movies, TV shows, games and ext. The only trade off with this phone and the note 3 is performance. The note has one the best CPU processors on the market the snapdragon 800 and the mega has the snapdragon 400 which is a mid level processor these days but delievers pretty decent enough performance to keep me happy and not use the note 3 as a daily driver which now sits in the box. I like the mega better than the note 3 because of the screen size even though its was the most powerful phone of 2013 but I prefer phones in the 6 inch range. The note 3 is just too small to me. That's just my opinion. So if you want a large phone with a decent amount of power, get this phone.",10.0

It arrived in a timely manner. I've loved using it, it's been great, until this morning. The SIM card inside was not being detected. I tried another card, it didn't detect it either. I was just using this last night with no problems. I called the company (BLU) and got suggestions for using the Wireless Update, but it said my software was up to date. I was told I had to factory reset it and try the card again. I removed the SD card and reset it. Set it up again, and it still did not detect my SIM card. I looked on the site for the return policy, and wouldn't you know it, the return policy said YESTERDAY JANUARY 31ST was the last day to return it. How convenient is that? I have appointments coming up that require me to make phone calls and I have no phone to call with on short notice. Now what? This is not a purchase that can be taken lightly, I'm NOT in a position to swiftly replace it.

When smart phones came into the scene I had to wait for them to become affordable for the general tight was public. I have to admit, my first smart phone was an iPhone 4s because it was already being discontinued and was free when I renewed my contract. It was so easy to use that I was instantly hooked! I was 49 years old but not computer illiterate. I had always loved photography and would often take pictures of the sunrise on my way home from work. People on Facebook couldn't believe my pics were taken with an iPhone. Then the Xperia z1 came out with 20.7 megapixel. I wanted to fuze the 2 together and thought this was the perfect option. I was wrong. Within 3 months I was scouring the internet looking for another iPhone. I found this phone. From the instant I pulled it out of the box I was in love all over again. It has such a solid balanced feel to it. Not HEAVY heavy. Just a solid reassuring feel. The ease of use, as opposed to Android phones. still amazes me. The pictures are decent, but I kept my Xperia just for the camera. I hate carrying 2 phones around. Especially since the Xperia is bulky and HEAVY. They now have a compact version, but I can't afford to change phones whenever someone get a good idea! My iPhone is easy to use and you don't get ""launcher overload""!

Moto G Play (4th gen.) - White - 16 GB - Unlocked,,149.0,5,"This is a great smartphone and its a brilliant deal at $130. It's fast, responsive and very intuitive to use. The interface is really clean and has no unnecessary apps installed. Camera is ok but I don't really care much about it. I mostly use it for browsing, messaging, music and for maps and directions. It handles them all pretty well. You can expand the memory up to 128 GB using a MicroSD card. Size is not so big that it becomes cumbersome to use. I can easily use this with one hand. All these factors persuaded me to buy this phone instead of other overpriced smartphones.If you want a smartphone for everyday use but don't want to spend a lot of money, I highly recommend this one.",4.0

Apple iPhone 5c 32GB (Yellow) - Verizon Wireless,Apple,155.0,2,"This may seem really ridiculous but I ordered this last week and got it Saturday. Before I got it activated the other night the screen was messing up on me. I was having a lot of fun trying to put in my WiFi information. Anyway, I got it activated last night and everything was working fine. But now it's back to the way it was before it was activated. The screen was acting like it was possessed or a chipmunk on rd caffeine. It kept going to comments or my messages or previous pages on the Facebook app and it even did it on the Safari app when I decided to just use Facebook on that. Still acted up. I was really looking forward to trying out Apple but I'm really disappointed. Even with that 9.0.2 update or whatever it is, it's still doing it. The phone itself is great but that touchscreen thing, REALLY needs to be fixed. As well as on their future models. The only other positive thing I can say is that it finally showed my music than my previous phone did (not an iPhone). It would show less than half of it even though it was all right on the micro SD card I had in it.I will try Apple again someday when it gets better hopefully. If not, it's either just not meant for me, I got a lemon, or I should just curse the fact that I have big fingers. Lol.",0.0

Huawei Honor X2 7.0 inch Android 5.0 Phablet Phone Octa Core RAM 3GB ROM 16GB Dual SIM (Add 32GB TF Card),XJKJ,226.99,5,"I like the X2. I finally reached the limit on how big of a phone I would want. It fits in my shirt pocket but that would depend on the style of shirt you wear. Mine arrived with google play already loaded on it, the only real issue I had was that the language was set in Malay. I could not seem to locate the language setting icon so I googled ""the word language in Malay"" and found the correct setting. Initially, to confirm that the phone was indeed in Malay I simply googled 2 or 3 words on the phone. I downloaded 2 or 3 keyboards to replace the Huawei one and finally decided to use the google keyboard. Being such a large phone I might wish the X2 was a bit thinner but not really a problem. I use T Mobile and get up to H+ speeds here in Vacaville, CA which has translated up to about 15 Mbps. I wish the US market would make tablets with built in phones. I also have a Huawei Mate 7 phone which is also fantastic; it has a 6 inch screen and works on T Mobile's LTE network. I looked at the Huawei P8 Max which has a 6.8 inch screen but it does not support US cell frequencies. In any case, the X2 is a great choice.Update. The phone continues to work great. Someone mentioned the phone not having multi-window. Actually, it is there and does work. Just swipe from top to bottom, tap shortcuts, scroll down and tap ""dual windows."" Then simply swipe upward with 2 fingers to get multi-window when browsing. I never used it on a previous phone I had but with this phone it makes that feature a practical option. You cannot open 2 Google Chromes at the same time but you can have Chrome in one window and Firefox or UC Browser in another. Early on I did have one ""page"" that showed icons with Chinese writing but something I did got rid of even that page. By the way, I updated to Android version 5.1.1. One app I like having that you need Android 5 Lollipop to use is ""ilos"". The ILOS app lets you record all your activities on the screen like a video; it is a screen capture app like Camtasia is for Windows (the later has a lot more features, of course). I may play around with different Launchers at some point, but Huawei's Iphone like Emui skin does not bother me like it bothers some reviewers. You can place 25 apps on your home page, if you like, and you are good to go.",15.0

(Model#: X511 WHITE)",Posh Mobile,69.99,5,"I've been using his phone for over a month now and I absolutely love it. Yes, the display is small but it's super colorful. The Google Play Store, lets you download plenty of apps that are compatible with this device.However it is a 4G phone, and my SIM is capable of LTE meaning I am not used to the slowness of the data. If you're connected to Wifi there shouldn't be a problem, and if you're used to 4G data then then you should be okay.It has a 2 mega pixel main camera and a VGA front camera, and if you came here for a good camera... Well probably not the best place to look. The main camera typically gets the job done however.With 4GB of internal memory, adding an SD card is a good idea especially if you love music and lots of apps. I haven't used very much of the data so I don't have many complaints.The charger is mini USB but the metal part of the charger that connects to the phone is a tad longer than your average USB so don't break it or lose it.Overall it's a very good media player and I don't regret purchasing it.

However, the adapter is a slow charger, and you have to get a Huawei-branded adapter (bought one of the Q2/3 compatible quick chargers on Amazon, but while they were advertised to be ""compatible w/ Huawei P9..."", they are only to the point of slow charging, and no quick charge) to get the rapid charging, otherwise a full charge takes over 2 hours.I imported my contacts from my HTC One (m7) and discovered that texting received, ""Invalid Recipient"". Internet searches revealed that I needed to either have them text me, and then reply, or to manually insert a ""+1"" before each mobile number to get texts working to imported contact recipients. This is due to the phone being an international version.My phone was configured when I brought in to the ATT store and receives texts and phone calls fine now, but I am unable to send or receive pictures (MMS).

The big one for me was how hot the phone got. For just using google Maps, to even playing Pokemon go for a little bit in the park, the phone got so hot I could barely hold on to it. I couldn't even imagine using this with a case on it might melt. Then when the phone detects that it gets too hot then it makes that big beautiful display lowers it brightness to where I can not see in the daylight anymore. I am having a lot of issue with it in the Sun.I have heard of these issues with other Samsung phones. Maybe its just the ones with this certain processor, I am unsure if the SnapDragon ones have this issues but the reason I got the international is that it could go to any carrier more or less and I could get the added performance of the Exynos Processor. Turns out it was a bad idea and the phone got so unreasonably hot that I could barely hold on to it. The phone also got noticeably slower as it got hotter. Probably because the processor was limiting itself.Maybe this could be fixed with a software update but I think this is more of a hardware issue. Maybe I just got unlucky and got a defective phone as i don't see many other people mentioning these problems. I do not blame Samsung or have any bad feelings for them.

Nokia Lumia 820 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Cell Phone - Black,Nokia,95.0,4,"this is my intro to WP8 so everything is different.CONs- Nokia suit does not work with WP8 so i could not import my contacts. which means i now have to type them in 1 by 1. if i get a work around for this i'll post an update.- No FM Radio. the specs say radio but there's no radio. according to what I've been reading Nokia's hardware will do radio but Windows drop the ball on the software. Some folks are hopeful that Windows will make an update to fix that but this phone has been out long enough for them to have fixed this by now so i don't think its a priority for them. Surprisingly i got a streaming radio app from the windows store (tunein) and it has my local stations. Suppressing because i'm from St. Lucia (in the Caribbean) where no one heard of. so if my local stations are there yours probably is too. the problem with this is you need wifi for this, which means the quality is poor depending on your connection and if i had to use a data plan for this it would get too expensive for free radio.- SD card slot is under the battery. my thoughts are that an SD memory card should have quick access without having to turn your phone off. With this phone you have to turn the phone, remove the cover and battery to get to the card.- the battery life is exactly as many reviews say. it sucks. i have to charge this phone EVERYDAY. if you get this phone my advise is to get extra chargers; have one at work, at home, in the car, at moms house... cause you'll need it. the good thing is the phone does not take long to charge. but truth be told most smart phones today have this issue. You have to keep them plugged in (and that does not hurt the battery by-the-way).i know i went on a bit about the radio and nokia suit thing but those were selling points for me. i first gave this 2 stars because of this but i reconsidered because the phone is a good phone. if you're going to advertise something and not deliver that will not make me buy from you in the future. Nokia suit was a big selling point for me because i have hundreds of contacts and having to re-enter them 1 by 1 every time i get a new phone is a pain. for this alone i no longer have any reason to have any brand loyalty to Nokia.if i could push myself past these 2 sticking points, i actually like this phone. its not as big as the GS3. it fits in my packet and hand easily. the touch screen is responsive. the camera is great. You can customize the tiles and there are plenty of apps to do whatever you want.I will love this phone for as long as it last (hoping for 2 years, any longer is a bonus). But if i had to do it over i would consider the Lumia 625... because it has radio.ps/ Turns out WP8 has podcasts. which is the only reason i have an ipod. so now i only carry one device.Update: 16/Jan/14- Now with radio. YAAH! after an update last night i now have FM radio. Happy Day. Now bumped to 4 stars.",1.0
"Blackberry Bold Touch 9930 CDMA GSM Unlocked Phone with Touch Screen, 5MP Camera and Blackberry OS 7 (Black)",BlackBerry,104.95,5,"This phone is beautiful, I paid a little more to get it new in its original box but it was worth the extra money and wait.

Many people said they had problems with their phone being locked onto a carrier, but I inserted my SIM and I am picking up AT&T flawlessly. The touch screen is responsive but you sometimes forget it is there due to the thumbpad. One of my favorite feature is that it tuns off and locks when you put it in the holster, but it turns back on and unlocks upon retrieval. The holster it comes with does not have a clip, so I recommend buying one. Overall, it is a great phone and I would buy it again.",0.0

"Nokia E6 Unlocked GSM Phone with Touchscreen, QWERTY Keyboard, Easy E-mail Setup, GPS Navigation, and 8 MP Camera - Silver",Nokia,269.1,2,"I bought this phone after having used the Nokia Nuron and X2, which both had their faults but were generally good phones. The same can be said for the E6 because its construction, video playback ability, great display, and very comfortable keyboard. However, the web browser without true flash playback (flash lite is discontinued by Adobe) and pretty limited app store were disappointing. However, I knew all that before buying the phone. My true problem was that the device sent to me continued to power on and off without any manipulation by anyone. I would often hear it power down and restart when it was simply sitting in my car's passenger seat or on the shelf at home. Additionally, these restarts would cause some memory loss in the phone, including contacts, apps, etc. This was unacceptable, and therefore I had to send the phone back to the warehouse. The Amazon warehouse does not offer replacement, so I will have to simply find a different phone.",2.0

"Samsung Galaxy S5 SM-G900FD Factory Unlocked Cellphone, International Version, Retail Packaging, 16GB, White",Samsung,,5,"I have to preempt this review by stating that it is not about the Android operating system or the Samsung hardware, but rather about the usefulness of having a dual-SIM phone and how to use it.I do extensive travel and as a long-time AT&T customers with an iPhone since day 1 have been plagued by sky-high international fees. I decided to take the plunge and use this phone for when I travel. To do that, two things are required: (1) a deep understanding of how Android handles multi-SIM, and (2) a way to 'trick' the AT&T SIM into believing it's still in the iPhone.(1) Android handles 2 SIMs as follows: there are 2 slots in this phone for micro-SIMs. Through the SIM management program you can select which SIM does what, and how both work. For example, you can designate SIM 1 as you data SIM (only one SIM can be a data SIM at any time). Another example: you can select whether the two SIMs accept simultaneous incoming calls. My experience is that it is pretty intuitive once you get the idea that you now have 2 numbers and 2 providers. In my case, when I travel, I use SIM slot 1 with the local SIM and SIM slot 2 with the AT&T SIM. For data I use SIM 1. I allow simultaneous incoming calls.(2) This is more tricky. First, you may have to buy a SIM adapter. For my AT&T iPhone nano-SIM, I got this one: MediaDevil Simdevil 3-in-1 SIM card adapter kit (Nano / Micro / Standard) and it works very well. Second, you have to configure the APN settings for your provider since the SIM is not pre-configured to be in the Samsung. In my case, the AT&T settings can be found here: http://apn-settings.com/us/att-apn-settings/. Once you input them, you restart the phone and you're now on the AT&T data and MMS plan. Note: you don't need to do this if you're just going to make voice calls. If you buy a local plan in the country of your choice, you will have to go through the same routine by following their APN instructions. I have found that most SIMs/plans you buy internationally are very different from local US plans as they assume you're going to put your SIM in a non-sponsored phone and need to configure it.My verdict on the usefulness of 2 SIMs is decisive: very positive.On the Samsung and Android: I'm actually impressed. Yes, I wish there were a dual-SIM iPhone but that won't ever happen I guess. Hence, this is the best choice and Samsung made it a very good one.UPDATE 1On a trip to Switzerland I noticed that Android does a lot of data 'checks/pulls', unless you configure your apps not to do that. Most notably (of course) email where default settings make it pull data every 15 minutes, but also location services and Android updates. You have multiple choices how to deal with this: one is to tell these services never to pull, causing you to always performmanual syncs, or another is to tell the services to only pull when you're connected to WiFi. Since many folks that use this phone do so because they roam extensively, I wanted to give this heads-up.",77.0

Performance is just top notch. I have installed like 8-10 games already including Dytona Racing, Asphalt 8 etc. They run so smoothlyScreen - Gorgeous screen I have used till date. Text is very sharp on screen. The only problem I faced is using this device in direct sunlight. I have to up the brightness to 80% to use in sun.Camera - I can safely say this is the among the best camera in mobile devices. Of course LG G4 is out and it is no comparison to this phone. However more manual controls are welcome.Gaming Performance - Mind blowing. Installed 8-10 games. Asphalt 8, Dytona Racing, Subway Surfers etc. Handles them without any lag.Battery - Medium usage will last you more than 1 day. Medium to High usage will last about a day and High users will have to charge device twice.Audio - Nice output from the read speaker and music processing in headphones is good too.UI - Beautiful UI. Knock ON and Knock code features are my favorite. LG UI offers lot of options and customization.To sum up, for about 350$, you can't go wrong with choosing LG G3. Bang for your buck.",1.0

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,292.98,2,This phone is for music lovers right? Speakers are good but my Bluetooth is horrible I put the phone in my pocket and simply turn around and my Bluetooth speaker will cut out don't have that problem with other phones anyone else have this problem? Did drop the phone once before I activated it though. Hitting the power and volume down at the same time will do a screenshot which seems almost unavoidable and it happens all the time and is really getting on my nerves hell my home screen freaked out or so I thought until I realized I was looking at a s***load of screenshots can't find an option the disable this feature yet. The cameras focus is horrible compared to my old Moto E and my Samsung Avant. Something about unlocking the screen and about the way the notifications work has really been annoying. I going to fix my old samsung Avant a throw this one in the trash if I can't find an easy fix for most of these issues,0.0

BLU Studio C 5+5 LTE Smartphone - GSM Unlocked - Gold,BLU,99.0,3,"I bought two of these phones because I wanted to surprise my friends, who were going away on a trip and both of them needed new phones. I looked at many different smart phones on here, specifically with 4G LTE, which in itself narrows the selection. This phone stood out to me. The price seemed ok, the specs sounded fine and the reviews were encouraging. So I bought two. I was excited about getting them, and giving them away but the joy of the surprise didn't last very long. Both phones have inaccurate sensors. If I tap a letter in the top row, it gives me language selection. I need four, sometimes five attempts to open an app because it doesn't respond to lighter touch. It becomes extremely annoying when you type a message and it frequently inserts a suggestion, just because you typed the letter slightly upward. Even for a budget phone like this one, I expected better adjustment. I also couldn't, like in my own phone, (which was the same price but seems a much better quality) calibrate the sensor to have a more accurate typing experience. There was no way to fix this.As I gave the two phones away, the frustration was high as I felt I had made a bad choice. I am returning at least one of them and have already ordered a phone of which I know that it works.There is some good about these phones however. The wifi is relatively fast and the phone itself is fast in opening apps for example. The screen is very clear and almost looks like a retina screen, very high quality. The colors are vibrant. This phone comes with a screen protector and a slim silicone case. All of that is absolutely great and I like that the sellers do sell a product with thought behind it. But all the good doesn't help if the one thing that makes a phone useable, being able to type or press on a symbol is not working well.",1.0

So everything is great, right? Wrong! The sole purpose I bought this for was to use in the workplace. Our company requires management software is installed: Company Portal (Windows Intune). As part of my job in IT, I have installed this on most all of my devices just for test purposes. One of the requirements is that the phone is encrypted. This is so someone cannot obtain your phone and have access to your entire Inbox full of company emails. On all my Android devices, this is a base function of the Android O/S under the security menu. The one exception: this phone does not have that option. I even contacted Blu support to inquire if this function is available and somehow I missed it. I got an email today from support in reply to my query that addressed how to do a hard reset. I would like to return it. But I think I will give this to my wife because it is still a great phone. It just totally failed to meet my needs which was to provide base Android functionality that is present on every other tablet and phone I have here.

BLU Studio C 5+5 Smartphone with Lollipop OS- US GSM Unlocked - Green,BLU,81.58,2,"Im rating this two stars based more on the battery and inconsistent volume and notifications. I was losing a percentage point of battery every two minutes, basically giving me 3 hours of usage, including standby time. I turned the screen down all the way and that helped a bit, but that made it hard to use the phone outside. Additionally, the volume seemed to stay at one level regardless of whether I adjusted the volume. Furthermore, this phone notifies you of everything all the time. Seriously, you could walk out of and in range of the same wifi network, say at your home, and it would beep and vibrate each time, really annoying. In the end, I just didn't like it, the lumia 640 and moto 3 2015 seem to be better phones at this price range, and the battery last much longer (days compared to hours). Nothing against BLU, I thought the build was nice, and the design appealing, the hardware just wasn't up to snuff with todays competition.",2.0

I could use this phone full time, even after stepping away from my daily driver, a Oneplus One.P.S. the included tpu case is a nice bonus considering it is impossible to find a case for a new model for at least a month or two!",0.0

Tried pressing power, power+up, power+down, power+up+down keys, 2 continuous days of usb charging and wall charging --- nothing helped M7 never starts, no lights, cold as dead. When I connect M7 with computer, computer makes a sound - and that's it. Computer of course did not detect anything as the phone is not powering on.Contacted the seller ""One Time Cell storefront"" to see whether he can share this phone's IMEI, so I can see whether there is a manufacturer warrenty, but seller do not have any info.

BLU Jenny TV 2.8 T276T Unlocked GSM Dual-SIM Cell Phone w/ 1.3MP Camera - Unlocked Cell Phones - Retail Packaging - White Blue,BLU,23.89,2,"I needed a simple phone for my upcoming trip to Germany, so this one seemed to be perfect for my purpose. When I first received the phone, everything was set in Spanish language, with the home town set to Mexico City. It took me a while to find out how to set it to English. I immediately tried the phone with my German SIM card, it worked fine for exactly 2 test calls (one outgoing, one incoming) and then I put it away. I was really impressed with the small price!When I arrived in Germany a few weeks later, my transport was not at the airport as usual. I tried to call them, but the phone did not work! Callers could hear me, but I could not hear them. I rebooted the phone and even reset ist with the same result. I could hear no sound, not when the phone turned on, not for the radio, or for a phone call. I did not bring a headset for phones with me on the trip because I wear hearing aids and would not be able to use the phone with a headset anyway. However I tried with a simple headset from the plane (no microphone), and I could hear the sound with that just fine.So I could not use the phone during my trip as intended and immediately sent a mail to BLU and asked customer service for help, because I thought there was a simple solution to the problem. They responded with a prefabricated mail and a link to a web form, where I could contact customer service. I filled out the web form, but of course I could not provide a working phone number overseas, and neither could I supply the requested IMEI number, because it is very tiny and I did not have a magnifier on my trip. Needless to say, they never reacted to my help request via the web form.Back home, I filled out the web form again, this time with all the required information. I received yet another prefabricated answer, with the suggestion to reset the phone to factory settings. I sent them yet another mail, telling them I had already tried that several times, with no luck. It was very frustrating because every time after a reset I had to change the language and the home town all over again.So now I even told them I was willing to exchange the phone for a more sophisticated one which costs about $100 more. Again, I received no reply from BLU customer service.A week later I sent them yet another email that I had lost trust in them because of their unresponsiveness and I just wanted a simple exchange for the same phone. This time they finally reacted, after four weeks and my fifth (!!!) question for help! Now they want me to send the phone for repair (not an exchange as I had requested!), at my own cost, which would be more then a third of the $18 I had initially paid for the phone.I read the warranty and it states that ""BLU may, at BLU's sole option, use rebuilt, reconditioned, or new parts or components when repairing any Products, or may replace Products with rebuilt, reconditioned, or new Products."" Well, there is no guarantee that my new phone will finally work correctly after the repair with rebuild parts, and I don't like to throw good money after bad. So I will probably just throw the phone away and look for another solution for my next upcoming trip to Germany. Maybe I'll have better luck with another company.",3.0

Star 4.5 US GSM (Blue),BLU,82.52,2,"I bought this phone specifically to use while traveling in Europe. The first issue that I noticed was simply how slow the phone was....15-20 seconds to open most apps (Gmail, facebook, uber, google maps). The second issue was that I trusted a previous reviewer who stated they got 4G speeds in Europe. To be clear this phone does not have 4G/LTE capabilities. Only 3G speeds.I was able to successfully use this phone in the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, and Sweden. Due to the speed issues of loading apps and download speeds I primarily used this phone as a mobile hotspot using data-only sim cards purchased in each country. However battery life is quite poor...lasting less about ~4 hours when used as a mobile hotspot.Overall, if you're looking for a cheap phone to use while in Europe I'd suggest looking at a newer model. This clunky brick works more like a phone from 2006 than 2016 which ultimately just leaves you banging your head against a wall. I purchased this phone at around $80 USD. I would have been better served to 1. buy a more expensive GSM unlocked phone that works more like a 2016 smartphone should. Or 2. buy a GSM unlocked mobile hotspot and simply tether my US based phone in Europe.",0.0

And now its on my sd card and even if i restarted the phone its still there and you better have flat head screwdriver or a straightened out paper clip to get the sd card out not to mention the sim card and the sd card are ontop of eachother so hope you get it in the right one.

Had to turn brightness all the way down because the light is overwhelmingly blinding and gave me a migraine within minutes of use. (There is also a warning issued with this phone that said due to the brightness the phone can trigger seizures.) The booklet that comes with this phone is very very small. The phone takes a micro Sim card. At first I could not get it to fit in the slot because it stuck too far out and battery wouldn't fit in with it in. Contacted my carrier who told me that all micro sim cards are the same size & should fit. Tried to contact customer service but oh yeah, I couldn't because they DON'T, I said they DON'T have a customer service telephone anywhere. Even Amazon who fulfilled the order couldn't find a number! I found that outrageous. You had to email them and they would email you back a response. How long would that take? Anyway I was going to have to take the phone into my service provider. But finally I studied the very small picture in the booklet which only stated to put the sim card in. It didn't tell you how. But upon close inspection I saw that the sim card goes in upside down with the cut corner end going in first. Usually it has always been the other way around. Had Posh had a contact number they could have easily told me this and saved me and everyone I drove crazy a lot of frustration. So even though I got the sim card in I most definetly don't want to deal with a company that doesn't care about it's customers enough to provide them a contact number.",0.0

LG Xpression C395 Unlocked GSM Slider Cell Phone with Touchscreen + Full QWERTY Keyboard - Red,,179.99,2,"I find this phone incredibly frustrating to use. When my Sony Ericsson W910i Walkman phone died, I got this LG phone because I wanted a full QWERTY keyboard for composing text messages. I wish I'd just gotten another Walkman phone. The LG Xpression is way too heavy, possibly due to it's having a touch screen. It's not a smart phone and doesn't run apps, and I can see no good reason why this phone should have a touch screen. When I'm on a call, the screen locks almost immediately. If I'm navigating through a phone tree and it says something like, ""Press one for service, press two for sales"" I have to hit the power button to turn on the screen and then swipe up from the bottom to unlock the screen, select the phone icon from the touch screen menu, and then I can press a number. By the time the phone tree has asked me to make a second level choice the screen has powered down and I have to go through the whole sequence again. It's incredibly frustrating.I used to take a lot of photos with my Walkman phone. The photo mode on the LG is run entirely from the touch screen. Activating the phone mode is cumbersome, and then taking a picture is awkward due to the touch screen controls. I used to take hundreds of photos a month. In the year that I've had this LG phone, I've taken fewer than a dozen photos. Because of the weight and clumsy UI, I've basically stopped carrying a cell phone at all, which has its benefits to be sure, so if you want a phone that's so cumbersome that you never want to pick it up, this may well be the phone for you.I give it two stars instead of one because it actually does make phone calls, and once connected the calls seem no more likely to drop on this phone than on any other I've owned in the past.I've learned my lesson. I will never consider another LG phone.",3.0
Motorola Droid RAZR 4G LTE Android Smartphone Verizon (black),Motorola,159.0,5,"So my teen daughter got an older (4) iPhone for her birthday, and she did reasonably well with it until it ended up in the toilet of the bathroom at the library. She was upset. Needless to say, after trying to dry it out it would not work. She had to go a couple of months without a phone before we allowed her to get a replacement.When we were looking at replacements, I knew we were going to get her a little older, probably used phone. She decided since she is on an iPad all day at school, she didn't want another iPhone. Her dad has the newest version of the RAZR and she likes it, so we found this one at a really good price.Got it really quickly, fired it right up and got it activated without a problem. She is still learning some of the functions on it, but she says that is part of the fun of having a new phone, but loves it. It texts great, calls great and takes great pictures. She hasn't downloaded too many apps yet, but what she has have worked great.Overall we are really happy with this phone for her.

Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - White - 16GB - U.S. Warranty,Motorola,249.0,5,"This phone is absolutely great. Easy setup, plenty fast, and it works with ALL major carriers; what else could you want? The phone itself is built well too; Gorilla Glass 3, metal trim, and extremely rugged and sturdy even without a phone case (but I would suggest one anyway). In terms of specs it's actually pretty comparable to most current generation flagship phones as well (maybe 10-20% less specs). The battery lasts long and has the turbo charge feature, and the screen quality and sound quality are both stellar! But most of all the #1 thing about this phone that will really push it over the edge is the PRICE which is unbelievable!Now Amazon has a version of this phone that makes it more affordable in exchange for ads but for me I just couldn't see how saving $50 was worth seeing ads for the entire life of the phone. This phone (Plus model) also has better specs than the Amazon one, has a quite a bit better camera, and has my favorite feature ever: a fingerprint scanner that not only secures your phone but wakes it too. I mean really this phone has just about everything you could want and then some, and apparently is water resistant (I haven't tested and don't intend to try). Ultimately if you're looking for value on a phone and really can't see yourself dumping $600-900 on a flagship phone then this is DEFINITELY the phone for you.The one thing I will say about this phone is it does seem to have the overheating problems everyone talks about. It's not like dangerously hot or anything but it's definitely warmer than most other phones; however, it only gets hot when it's under severe load like recording video (for long periods), playing a hardware intensive game, or loading up all your apps from your old device. Despite these problems though it's still well worth the money as you're not going to find a phone with this much value without camping outside a store for 48 hours for Black Friday.",7.0

It would not activate on freedompop.Make sure you get the ESN and confirm it with a phone provider before buying one of these. Even though this is an SPH-L720 and I had another SPH-L720 on freedompop already -- there are ESN based restrictions placed by the carrier. Sprint only releases a certain range of ESN numbers to freedompop. The SPH-L720 that I happened to receive was restricted to JUST Sprint, and I could not use freedompop with it.Ended up switching to Sprint anyway, so I am keeping the phone.

HTC One M7 32GB GSM Unlocked 4G LTE Android Smartphone - Black,HTC,249.99,4,"I didn't rate it with 5 stars because the phone have the AT&T software and I cannot use the phone as WiFi Spot (tethering).The problem there is AT&T has a hidden program that checks with AT&T if you have a plan that allows tethering before it enables.When not on that carrier, the program won't work!This feature is essential for my business so I have to use a custom ROM. I don't want to do it, but it looks is the only way.If you don't mind this, so go ahead and buy it because the HTC ONE M7 have great specs.It works great in my country (Costa Rica) and I'm able to connect with 3G and 4G.The only thing to configure was the APN with my carrier information.The S4 is also an excellent phone but the style and materials of the HTC One make the difference for a more serious and modern smartphone.",3.0

"5.5"" Phone Unlocked Dual Sim Quad Core-JUNING Android 5.1 Cellphone Blue",JUNING,99.99,5," This phone is a very pretty looking phone. It offers a slim profile however still great battery length. The quality is great. I was really satisfied with both the video and sound the phone offers. I have to say the color of the phone is one of my favorite features. It's not a tacky gold color. It don't appear cheap. It's actually more of a flat yet metallic look. The phone is very comfortable to hold and definitely isn't heavy. The battery, sim card slot, and SD slot are very easy to access and use. For me, this is very beneficial as I have to swap batteries often since I have to be on mobile web many hours a day. I often have to store photos and files on the SD cards for work. I also flip my sim cards between phones for work as well. This phone made things more convenient for me. The next favorite feature is the hot spot and tethering. I tether often with work and home life. I live in a town where the internet is very slow, and when I turn my tethering on, I can accomplish all my tasks faster than if I had just used my home wifi. The phone comes preloaded with both apps and quick load tabs. If your a busy person on the run like I am, these features are lifesavers. I often have to swap back and forth between four apps, and use many internet pages all day long. The fast tabs stop you from typing in URLs incorrectly. This phone helps me in both my personal and work life. The phone holds signal better than the prepaid phone I use. The battery life seems to last longer as well. I really enjoy this phone. I've enclosed a video to see the features of the phone. I would recommend this phone. I received this phone for free or at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest opinion.",10.0

Moto G Play (4th gen.) - Black - 16 GB - Unlocked - Prime Exclusive - with Lockscreen Offers & Ads,Motorola,149.99,5,"One year ago I was scared and angry as my brand new lg g3 landed on my cereal bowl and shattered. The LCD screen and digitizer were completely destroyed. I tried to plead with Verizon but to no avail as they wanted me to pay 250 and I even contacted LG themselves and their response was mutual they wanted 100s to fix the phone due to self negligence. I had no ideal what to do I'm just some poor college kid who was dependent on my smartphone. The only phone I had laying around was the Nokia 8855 which was so old that even my grandpa didn't want to use it anymore and the moto g 1st gen. I knew nothing about the product line at the time as I always used an Lg phone or galaxy. But my oh my that phone was something special. Never did I expect to use it so long as it’s been great phone and surpassed my expectations. But I’m at the point now when I wanted something new but still cheap as my two contract still has not expired and will not till November. 5.1 Lollypop was the last update to come to that phone and no gyroscope which means no google cardboard. I I researched for days and days and on everyone's list the moto g play was on their for a great budget phone coming soon. I was surprised it only had 2 gb of ram and a snapdragon 420 or something how could this thing even handle android marshmallow which critics everywhere say needs at least 2gb of ram to function? Anyway as previous moto g owner I knew of the awesomeness that is the moto g and this phone looked like the true spiritual successor as Lenovo has been moving away from the design and price point since the g3. So I didn't have any more time to waste I went to ebay but it was not there unfortunately as this is a new phone. Luckily I knew someone who has connections and I was able to secure an early copy of the device. Anyway their has and never will be a phone that compares to the moto g 1st gen but this comes close. On ebay you can buy a very functional moto g first gen but this phone is much better and is a proper successor. Surprisingly it's smoother than some modern phones out there like at one point I had a galaxy s5 I'm sure this thing was more snappy than that. Touchwiz back then was a joke I know not any more but it was. Please don't let specs or benchmarks judge this phone you need real life application that's simply the only way to see the greatness that is this phone. It runs most apps perfectly even heavy games like NBA Jam and Asphalt 8 runs fine and can maintain a good frame rate. To be honest it loads web pages very fast even on data. It comes with very little bloatware as Motorola has always embraced a close to stock experience with their products. The only true downside I could say the moto g play is the root ability. They really don't want you to root this thing kingo and king root don't work, stump and towel have a similar fate you really have to know what you're doing before trying to root this thing and before I forget the lack of sd card ability of the original moto g is finally gone so that’s nice. The camera is pretty decent to 8MP front facing camera will get the job done with light. At night it’s not as good but still good enough you still have that weird pixel effect when it’s dark. But overall for the price of an expensive meal you will have a functional smartphone that at times will beat your flagship in certain processes. I love this phone and the original it saved my arse. As this nightmare lg g3 contract finally ends in November I look back on this time and think it was not that bad the moto g 1st gen and moto g play are good phones. Don't spend 700 on a new phone or 200 to fix it use. This phone is the new holy grail of all android value phones it's a masterpiece and a technical marvel. Seeing the Moto G4 makes me sad as Lenovo is abandoning what made the moto series so legendary. I hope one day the realize their mistakes before it's too late. In short this phone is the great but nothing compares to the moto g 1st gen.",54.0

Apple iPhone 5c 16GB (Pink) - AT&T,Apple,519.0,1,"I believe I was purchasing a new - not refurbhished item. However, the phone has been problematic since it was activated. After a few months of use, it began to power itself down automatically after 5 to 20 minutes of use. It also didn't hold a charge for very long. I took it to a recommended repair shop and the technician suggested that the battery could be bad. Upon opening the phone to change the battery, he discovered a somewhat bloated battery - indicating that it had probably been wet at one time. (I can attest that the phone has never been dunked!) He also said that ""stickers"" inside the case indicate that the phone was a refurbished one. I had never had it serviced before and as said, I thought I was buying a new phone. When I ordered, there was no indication to say it was not anything but new. Upon notifying the seller that I received a used/refurbished rather than a new phone, I received a canned reply that basically said I had 30 days from purchase to return the phone - a totally unsatisfactory answer. However, for $65 (plus tax) spent on a new battery, the phone now works well. I certainly would not buy from this dishonest provider again.",4.0

As of 10/2015 the Windows Phone app store is still mostly spam and spyware. Some of the major companies are represented (Facebook, Twitter, etc), but for every valid, safe app there are at least 5 spam apps that try to masquerade as the real thing.Unfortunately for me, almost everything I do is integrated into my Google account. You can check Gmail on the Windows Phone OS, but getting your calendar to sync is very hard - even for a techie like me. There is no app for Google Voice and no way to easily integrate Voice into the phone's calling. I just have to stick with Android.",1.0

Honor 8 Dual Camera Unlocked Phone 32GB - Midnight Black - GSM - US Warranty,Huawei,399.99,5,"So far so good. I am coming from a Nexus 5 and needed an upgrade. I tried the Pixel and it was an amazing phone, loved the simplicity of Google phones but not the price. I ended up returning it because I couldn't bring myself to spending $850 on a phone, which brought me here. Was going to buy last years Nexus 6P but I read that Huawei came up with a better and newer phone this year.After reading review after review, the consensus has been good battery, good camera, fast, and unfortunately a bad OS. I was really worried because I have grown really fond of plain android over the last 3 years but the cyber sale was too good to pass up. When I got the phone, I was immediately turned off by the lack of an app drawer so after about 30 mins with the phone I downloaded the Google Now launcher and all was well!!! I also downloaded all of the standard google apps (gmail, photos, messanger, calander, keep, clock...) while uninstalling as much of the bloat as possible (good thing Honor comes pretty bare). I read up on the net about all of the buried settings to enable/disable apps from running in the background while off. Now the phone runs great, and I can barely tell its a not plain android, except the notification setting pull down as it takes some getting used to.This phone is very fast and has a great camera, not as good as the pixel but it was about 500$ less I think I can live with it! The fingerprint sensor is crazy fast and I love that you can set it up as a shortcut for different tasks, especially because the power and volume being on the same side of the phone made taking screenshots one handed very difficult. Now I can set my fingerprint double tap to take care of that.Time will tell if this phone holds up, I'm still concerned about the possibility of not getting security updates or OS updates but we'll see. For now I am happy about my purchase. If anyone is reading this and is on the fence, just do it!!!",4.0

Casio G'zOne Ravine C751 Rugged Cell Phone Verizon,Casio,73.97,5,I did not want to spend big money on a smartphone through my wireless carrier. I needed a phone that could keep up with my lifestyle.

"Blackberry Q10 Unlocked Cellphone, 16GB, White",,79.95,5,"For all of you who are looking to buy an unlocked phone, make sure it is for the network you are on or are going to be using. I recently switched from Verizon to AT&T and was told that I could use my Verizon phone on the AT&T network as long as I unlocked the phone. This is partially true. The phone works but certain features are not available and I had to charge the battery at least 4 times a day. Eventually I called Verizon tech support to see what was going on (because the Blackberry was an unlocked Verizon phone) and was informed that Verizon phones cannot be used on other networks because of the complexity of Verizon's network. So essentially I was having that battery issue because I was using a phone built for the Verizon network on an AT&T network and they use different frequencies for their reception and different internal components, and for that reason I was having such bad battery life. So, if you are with AT&T don't buy a Verizon phone. It will probably still work, but not every feature will be available and your battery life may be non-existent. Aside from the network issues the phone was awesome and I can't wait until the Q20 is released.",1.0

"BlackBerry Classic Factory Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BlackBerry,149.99,3,"If your in last place shouldn't you be going faster than the rest of your competitors to catch back up in the race. I wish someone would tell BB that before they implode because I love using BB handsets!!!This BB Classic has a extremely bad flaw that makes it a deal breaker. Let me explain.The proximity sensor (the sensor that disables display while on a call with phone positioned at ear/face to eliminate accidental/unwanted input while on a call) is broke. PERIOD!! When the phone ""on edge"" whether vertical or horizontal the display turns off like it should, fine. But when the phone is flat the display DOES NOT turn off. This is very bad when you are using your shoulder and face to hold on to the device to free up hands to multitask or anything else the device will start muting, adding calls, repeat number taps, and so on. I was on a personal call the other day and knowingly called a client now he thinks I'm crazy. I keep unknowingly putting people on hold and rambling on only to realize later it was a wasted call. This is actually very dangerous as i have been talking while phone put itself on hold only to have that person call back and have the ringtone right in my ear by surprise scaring the heck out of me.There is know logical reason for the proximity sensor to disable itself just because the phone is flat. And it is not a single phone defect as I purchased 2 Classics and they both have the same problems.I also check to see if the happens with my Nexus 6 and Moto X 2nd Gen. Nope the display stays off while on a call even when phone is flat.This is a complete shame because I love this phone but cannot afford to lose business on a so called business phone. Until BB pulls its head out of its own UKW this one goes back.",5.0

Nextbit Robin Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone - Mint (U.S. Warranty),,249.99,4,"I would like to note first that this is not a Flagship device, but for the class of phone that this falls in it is perfect!.

It is very snappy and in my use of the device is was smooth with no stuttering or slow downs. It works great with basic games, but I don't think that this for someone who enjoys playing any graphics intensive games. My favorite feature is the look!

"Motorola Moto X - 16GB, Unlocked Phone - US Warranty - Black",Motorola,89.99,3,"I received the phone box in shrink wrap. The phone was in mint condition. The charger and cable do have Motorola logo on them but they're black, as opposed to white shown in the picture. It didn't come with its own sim card ejection tool either so you gotta find yourself a needle. Another weird thing was, when I turn on the phone, it didn't prompt me through the whole ""setting up"" process. It simply went to the home screen, as if someone already set it up before me. Back then I didn't think it was that big of a deal, yet turned out it was. Before I get into it, just want to first say that, there's pretty much nothing about the phone that I dislike. The phone is fast, snappy and very smooth when it comes to handling multi-tasking and such. The front camera has pretty decent, warm-colored, clear quality. The back camera is not the best i've used, yet not terrible either. Clear enough but not impressive. You get the idea...The call quality is great. Coming from a Nexus 4 user, the call quality is much better than my old phone. When I'm on speaker, the person on the other end don't even realize it. The quality is very clear with very minimal of background noises. The phone is 16gb as promised and NOT pre-loaded with bunch of useless apps that you'll end up deleting. The first day of using the phone I was very happy about it. Until I found one major problem about it, it has no mobile internet. I tried turning the mobile data button on and off several times, tried rebooting the phone numerous times. There's still NO mobile data. I went on internet and read several forum where people are discussing the same problems. It turned out I don't have the proper APN (Access Point Name) for this phone. My current carrier is T-mobile. And I've used several unlocked devices before with T-mobile and never had any problems. So this one had me do some extra work before I can get access to the internet I paid for. Considering that I like the phone so much, I was willing to do as much as I can to fix this problem. I started to manually input the APN for T-mobile USA. And for some odd reason, every single time I finish inputting every field and hit ""SAVE"", the thing never saves. Then I found out that I cannot make any changes for this single field called ""MNC"". The phone has it defaulted on 330, and with T-mobile, it needs to be mortified to 260. Every time I change it, the whole thing won't save. It simply disappears. Later, I read another article saying that I can manually mortify the file that comes with the phone with all the APN information. After it's been changed accordingly to my carrier, it should be able to work. However, I cannot get access with the file without having the phone rooted. I could only read the file which did shown that T-mobile was not one of the carriers that the phone covers. So I gave up, I wasn't going to root the phone just so I can get access to my mobile data. So I factory reset the phone and planned to have it sent back. After I did that, the phone turned back on and was showing dialer screen immediately ask me to activate it. As it turned out, there's a number it automatically dials when you choose to have it activated. You won't even know what number it's calling. But you'll probably get a message saying ""your account is not authorized to make calls to this phone number"". So there, that's why when I first received the phone, it went to the home screen right away. Someone had to go in there to activate the phone with their own sim card I supposed, and it might just work for your carrier and it might not, like my situation. It's a shame I had to return it. It is still a great phone and I liked it very much. I would definitely keep it if it didn't cause me such trouble.",11.0

Motorola RAZR V3 Black (AT&T),Motorola,21.11,1,"Short review - if you actually want what this phone only promises, do yourself a favor and buy a SidekickLong review:Pros:One - It's a cool looking phoneOK, that, and battery life on standby - over 7 daysCons:- menu interface from ""heck"" - common functions are ""10 clicks deep""- no sync - if you want it on your phone you're going to enter it via the 10-digit keypad (or possibly pay an additional $30 for whatever software Motorola offers, but I never looked at it) The USB interface does nothing for you.- charging - it has a mini-USB interface to doesn't charge via USB (???? or mine was broken - dunno 'cause I sent it back)- every single data bit that passes from the phone is billed against your data account- it's not that good of a phone (at making decent phone calls)- it's worthless as a chat tool, web browser, or email tool- it's marginal as a cameraIf you have to have the coolest phone on the block then this is the device for you.If you want an actual useful piece of gear, or one that doesn't have outrageous charges to get the full functionality offered look elsewhere.Every piece of contact information has to be entered manually because as far as I can see there's no software included with the phone for Sync. Motorola will sell you some $30 add-on (to a $400 phone - how awesome!) that appears to offer management of pictures and sounds, but I see no mention of actual useful phone data entry.Issues I had with my phone -It made terrible phone calls - particularly when calling my home number. There was a constant, electronic chatter - and calling my number with another cell immediately showed no issues with the line. This happened every time i called.The impossible mountain of moving my contacts to a new device - All of my contacts have multiple phone numbers, email addresses, and in some cases URLs. According to Cingular (as they are the only ones I talked to) there is no way to sync this data to the phone - it all hs to get punched in via the 10-digit keypad. This is insane for a phone of this pricetag.The use of my ""data plan"" - I was astounded to see that every single action you take with this phone from a ""data"" perspective is billed against your account. Yep - signing on to and off of AOL COSTS YOU BITS. This is insane. That, coupled with the actual limit to the number of messages you can send before insane charges occur in just another part of how Singular (and other carriers) are ""doing it wrong"" with ""extended data devices"" like this phone. On my Sidekick I message, browse, and email to my hearts content without every worrying about my current ""bit count"" and what's going to show up on my bill.Lastly -It just died - when I when to actually try and use the phone again after my first week of ownership, I found the phone dead, unwilling to power on. Charging for day did nothing.I may have gotten a lemmon, which is why I did not comment on the Bluetooth - but it took about 40 attempts to get my (also new) Motorola headset to sync with this phone.In re: BT - I will say that it's an unbelievably poor thought-out number of key-clicks to toggle bluetooth on & off - like a dozen.I sent this thing back - it's worthless. I'm replacing my 3-year old Sidekick (one) with a Sidekick 2. I think once you've gotten used to a QWERTY device you can't ever go back to entering data via a 10-key.Don",44.0

"Motorola KRZR K1 Unlocked Phone with 2 MP Camera, MP3/Video Player, and MicroSD Slot--International Version with Warranty (Black)",Motorola,82.99,3,"Overall: After a bit over a month of usage, I'd call it OK.PROs: It works. It has a camera and video player.CONs: The video player is not what I expected. Key pad is small. The view on the tiny screen is so-so.Okay, I admit, I haven't used the phone a lot yet or gotten greatly familiar with it. I was looking for a phone that I could use in the U.S. and abroad, where I am living and working now, and I was looking for one I could use to record video/audio without having to lug around another device. (Is there a device out there for under $300, let's say, that has an unlocked quad-band phone--not one that comes with the purchase of two-year cell phone plan, a PDA, and a decent video camera all in one?)Video record--20 secs at a time:The big disappointment was the video record. I was looking forward to having it available when I'm out and about and want to record something unexpected happening, which is fairly often in Nairobi. It records for only 20 seconds at a time. One time it didn't even capture the audio. And, when I converted the videos to my computer, they were the inky dinkiest little things I ever imagined. I can only pray that the audio will at least record--there are times when all I really want is to record some sound...Russian:The phone, books, and keypad came in Russian. Now, of all the languages they could have chosen, Russian was a good one for me, since I have a Masters in it. I can see how that might be a bit tough though for someone who doesn't know a language. Maybe they should provide some quickee instructions with the phone on switching the phone to English. Just a thought... The keypad in Russian is a little annoying. Maybe someday I'll be so familiar with the keypad that I don't need to look, but, alas, I have just gotten into txting the last couple years living in Kenya, where it's really cheap. So, some of the Russian letters that look like English letters throw me off at times.Keypad:I am coming from a simple Nokia phone whose keypad was very nice for my fingers. I do not have big fingers, but the KRZR keypad is too small and hard to use for my taste.MP3 Player:Plays quite well...nice...I like it. I will look forward to using that in my car in Kenya...much easier than dealing with CDs (even if I had a CD player in the car). Not sure how that will suck the battery power--will have to find out.MicroSD card--no more than 2GB:I did see this somewhere later, but, do realize the phone supports no more than a 2GB card. I got a 4GB--doesn't work. The 2GB works great.I haven't tried the phone yet in Nairobi, where I will be using it extensively. So, basically, the jury is still out... Just wanted to give you my initial thoughts.",1.0

I was a bit concerned when I opened the back of the phone and one of the gold-prong-thingy (I don't know what that's technically called) was bent. I bent it to the way it's supposed to be and even though it works I have been noticing that the battery drains so fast. I don't know if it's because I have it in 4G setting and I use a lot of apps..? or maybe it's related to that bent thing. Anyway, within about 30 mins of using it, it goes from 100% to 75% on constant use. I guess you get what you pay for, right? So, I'm giving this phone a 3 even though it was a 5 when they delivered it promptly and they packaged the whole phone nicely. First impressions didn't last this time.

"ZTE Axon Pro Factory Unlocked Phone, 64 GB Phthalo Blue (U.S. Warranty)",ZTE,379.98,5,"This is an excellent phone for the price. The screen is lovely, and the overall speed of the phone is excellent. You can update it to Android Marshmallow out of the box.It's surprisingly manageable, for the size, also, and I've found the battery life to be perfectly acceptable, if not amazing. It's better than the 1st gen Moto X it replaced. Also, it charges super fast (unlike Oneplus 2, which has no fast charging, despite its fancy USB C port...). The home button doubling as a notification light is also nice, in my opinion- a pleasant surprise. The software is almost stock Android, with some minor changes.The camera is quite nice. It doesn't always take great indoor shoes, but Bokeh mode is very fun, and looks great, in my opinion. While I wish it had OIS, the camera software is quite robust. There are a ton of settings that you can tweak.Heat has not been a problem (despite the 810s reputation). Especially with a cover on it, I'm not even noticing it getting warm under normal use.Only negatives so far: The top speaker (the one that you put up to your ear) has the cutout on the right side of the phone, meaning that, if you center the earpiece on your ear, the sound is low. You have to put the right side up to your ear to hear clearly when holding in your right hand, and vice versa. For someone who wears glasses, it means that the phone bumps into them when in my right hand, which is a minor annoyance.Also, I wish the camera button was two-stage, so that it would refocus on demand. (Still, a double tap launches the camera, and the automatic focus is pretty quick, so that's something).Lastly, there are some minor software annoyances. The clock has the appearance of stock Android, but it's baked into their weather/clock widget, and seems to be stuck at version 3.1. I just disabled it and installed the Google one from the Play Store, as I prefer to use WeatherBug anyway. Also, the notification light wasn't enabled by default, so I had to search for the setting to turn it on.There are other things that I could count as negatives but, given the price, I think they're acceptable (no fingerprint scanner, no SD card slot). To me, the Oneplus 2 loses to this phone at this price, due to the lack of QHD screen, fast charging and NFC, as I believe phones for payments will only become more common over the next year.",3.0

LG Google Nexus 5X H798 16GB Factory Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Hexa-Core Android Smartphone w/ 12.3MP Camera - Carbon/Black,LG,394.98,5,I've had a variety of smart phones and alot of experience with different Android products. And when it comes to Android you really can't go wrong with Google's Nexus line of phones. My previous driver was a Nexus 4 and ever since owning that device and getting as much use out of it that I did I decided it would be best to stick with what I liked from my previous experience in moving forward with the Nexus 5X. That being said I am very happy thus far with the way the phone has been working. It's a great phone at a great price and I am very impressed with how smoothly it has been working.The major issue for me that I thought I was going to have with this phone is the 2gb 's of RAM but don't let that sway you. This phone handles everything I do throughout the day and then some with Nexus like ease. I am very happy with the camera and the performance I am getting out of it. This is a fast phone and especially so while browsing. Ultimately you pay for what you get. With this phone you pay up a little bit for a great Android user experience with Google's no bloatware / vanilla version of Android on upper mid tier hardware. If you are looking for a solid phone that won't break the bank and works when you need it to... look no further. This is a great phone for daily use and should be up there on your list even amongst other flagship phones while shopping Android. So long as I have a choice I will be sticking with Vanilla Android.,0.0

I mean the REAL Galaxy Note 5 is amazing, my friend has it and I loved it so I decided to buy it for myself, after watching reviews I knew I had to have this phone! I bit the bullet so to speak and found it on amazon, used for a cheaper price!Since I know amazon has a great return policy I decided to buy it.I was pleasantly surprised though the description said there were scratches I didn't see a single scratch! great huh :-) I was so excited decided to start checking out the features of the phone, the main feature I loved about this phone was the off-screen note option so I pushed the stylus... nothing... I dug my finger under the stylus and realized that it isn't the correct stylus for the phone, looked on amazon and seen an OEM stylus for 9.99 so no problem :-) I figure the feature didn't work because the stylus was incorrect. As I got deeper into the phone I realized several very important things, the most important was that there was no IMEI number so I can't get it activated, it was only after I connected to the internet via wifi that I seen an IMEI number and checked it out on snafu and it was invalid, I should've guessed considering the last numbers were 123456..but my dismay didn't stop there!! I looked into the gallery and there were two videos on the s.d card.. yes the non-existent s.d card, both videos were of something in an Chinese/Vietnamese?? I don't speak or understand the language to tell which language it was but I am guessing Chinese.syrI looked into my settings, and clicked on storage and seen that the actual phone onlly has 8gb of storage but the sd card is 32 gb isn't that strange?I started playing with the settings and so many of the amazing features didn't work on the phone, besides the fact that I can't even get it activated which makes it just a tablet for me.I am not saying all of the sellers here are dishonest, I don't even believe that amazon warehouse is dishonest, however when buying it make sure to ask the seller for the IMEI number in advance.I just went to the browser to actually leave this review and it's in Chinese. so I had to use my computer.I will try to do a video review tomorrow to show all of the things I mentioned and more,",12.0

I used a micro sd card but you cant install apps on the external card so once I booted up the phone and started doing the updates it had run out of space and I couldn't even update the OS default apps.",0.0

I updated the latest and had problems with the phone that took me two days to correct. Also the software that goes on your computer is not well thought out. It wants to copy aqll your email lists even if you don't want it too and then you have to manually delete as desired. Plus I am still having trouble downloading internal photos using the phone as a form of a usb. There is most likely an easier way but the phone handbook is pretty sketchy and using sony's web site hasn't improved these problems...they are hard to contact and get solid answers from.From a android platform phone standpoint this is a really easy phone to use, has a lot of free apps and is fun to use. the camera works great in all but the closest focusing. too much close focusing on the zoom produces grainy photos.",0.0

BLU Tank II T193 Unlocked GSM Dual-SIM Cell Phone w/ Camera and 1900 mAh Big Battery - Unlocked Cell Phones - Retail Packaging - Black Yellow,BLU,17.94,3,This phone was OK for an inexpensive travel phone. My main issue was that there was no clear way to adjust call volume which was not quite loud enough in some situations. The back fell off rather easily as well. The manual was tiny and had very little useful information. At first it was difficult to figure out how to load the SIM cards. One faces up and the other one down and you have to slide down a metal bracket that holds the SIMs which is not mentioned in the manual. The user interface is easy enough to learn. Battery life is excellent and the large battery gives the phone a solid feel. The display is big compared to some of the othe BLU models which was good. It worked overseas with a SIM purchased in that country. Tape the back on and it will work OK. Didn't try it with both SIMs in place.,1.0

Samsung Galaxy Note 4 N910a 32GB GSM Unlocked Smartphone Charcoal Black (Certified Refurbished),Samsung,338.99,1,"This seems to be an AT&T phone filled with bloatware. wont let me setup my phone n sim. sim works in other phones and i can access my contacts from the sim. The box it came in was really dirty... and the buttons and screen was not responsive much. Infact the phone lagged often just navigating menus. I paid for a unlocked phone. not a AT&T phone. Also the phone froze with a at&t symbol first startup. That pretty much made me livid.So buyer beware. I wanted this phone for its color.EVERYother unlocked phone i have ever bought ever was just put in the sim setup n go.this. Nope.. At&T all the way. so im pretty much mad. If they had mentioned that i would not have bought this. Do they want me to study how to jailbreak my unlocked phone to be clear of at&t bloatware?I'm really dissapointed also.in how laggy it was. makes me wonder if this is even a note 4...it even has a AT&T startup.im sending this back. the box was dingy no stickers no real manual inside. there is a AT&T quickstart guide inside though! i didnt purchase a AT&T samsung note. if i wanted that i woulda bought it from AT&T.i wont buy a refurbished phone from Amazon again. This was a really bad experience. The total cost was 540, i just thought itd look like the picture also. didnt even. picture looks slightly metalic. its just dingy plain white. looks like cheap plastic. at that price which is the same as other notes.. i really bought this for the looks of the picture. WHICH DID NOT DELIVER...so many problems. I dont think i ever been this dissapointed in something i bought from amazon before. I spent lot of money for this",30.0

I have a few games I play on it and there's not much lag. The only thing is BLU phones do come with some bloatware, so I had to remove that. After that I installed Nova launcher on it as the stock launcher sucks. It doesn't have an app tray or anything. But that was an easy fix by installing Nova launcher. Overall good phone, I purchased this case (https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B01DEYYD5G/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2) for it. With a little modification with a knife it fits well. I've dropped it a couple of times and it seems to be okay, but I think that's because of the case. There's some negative reviews on here about it breaking quickly, but I'm not hard on my phone, so its standing up pretty well. The call quality is good and the speakers in it are loud.

Huawei Ascend Mate 7 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Smartphone with 13MP Camera - Black,,264.77,5,"Great phone, bought this in 2016 to save some cash without compromising quality too much - the gamble paid off. Works great. Awesome battery life - great screen on time, but where this shines is when the screen is off - run Pandora or Google maps all day without the battery budging, I love that. Updated to marshmallow which fixed all the weird quirks this had software wise - the messaging app is still garbage, just used Google messenger and that's working just fine for group mms. Likes to default to h+ instead of lte because I'm in the US, but I really can't tell the difference unless for some reason I lose my mind and try to download something huge. But in those cases I am able to force it to use lte by just toggling the ""lte on/off"" button in settings - that gives me better speeds than my old HTC m8 could.

BLU Life XL - LTE Smartphone - GSM Unlocked - 16GB +2GB RAM - White,BLU,622.9,5,"this is the cheapest and best non-mediatek phone on the market. period. Don't waste your time with that $50 Blu phone that has the highest, its specs and hardware performance is WORSE than the 4.4.2 Android HTC Desire 510 that I just upgraded from, this phone's Antutu score was just under 30k which is a 10K jump up from that HTC, also its screen is larger but not obnoxiously large, 5.0 inch is as big as I'd ever get. also as I said since its not Mediatek and actually has Qualcomm 410 which is a very popular and battery efficient CPU the chances of ROM support is very high, especially since you can unlock the bootloader right from the developer options. works on virtually every LTE GSM bandI don't care about the camera and other stuff, I literally use my smartphone as a GPS device with Gmaps set to offline/Wifi only and my Ting SIM card is there for bare necessities in an emergency, all the other upgrades and stuff are over wifi at phone, but even if I used the phone as a every day desktop replacement this is pretty much as much as I'd pay, the only other phone is the ASUS which has CM13 support and is almost 2x the price, but the truly stock Android makes this a very suitable compromiseThe only slight downside is the screen being polarized, but you can flip it sideways in the sun to fix that, also the back is kind of a pain to get off and back on but its SUPER light compared to my previous phones which had smaller batteries, smaller size in general.I'll also try to find a case back that's a bit more rubbery for grip, this is quite slippery compared to the rubbery back on the HTC 510 but other than that, highly recommended for people who want a phone that does everything, minus a $500+ price hike because of a name on the case and a 2yr deal",0.0

"BlackBerry Classic Factory Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BlackBerry,149.99,5,"This is a fantastic phone. I haven't truly loved my phone in a long time. It's a shame there aren't more apps. I think a lot of other people would like this phone as well.If you're not somewhat technically savvy and apps are important, stick to your Android/iPhone. Most of the apps on the other 2 OS you can get to work on the Blackberry, but it takes some research. I was not able to get Hulu on my phone at all. Snapchat installs and runs, but it runs poorly compared to the iPhone. If you're reading that Netflix is available because the Amazon AppStore is on Blackberry now, that's BS. Amazon App Store is on BB, but they have stripped pretty much every decent app on there.Other than Hulu, I don't feel like I've given up much, and the tradeoff is great for me. This phone feels indestructible. I don't have a case on it and I'm not even worried. The keyboard is huge for me. I've never understood why we abandoned keyboards and started making phones bigger and tablets smaller. Honestly if iPhone would have just stuck to the size of the 5, I probably wouldn't have switched but man I am glad I did. Blackberry really has made a good product here. They just may have won me over. Now if they can just get some apps on their own store, they might actually be able to win some of you as well.",3.0

I have been using the phone for less than 2 weeks and I am very close to flushing it down the toilet! Within a few days of using it, i noticed it started freezing for hours on end and only a battery pull can resolve that temporarily.... Please note that I have only ever downloaded one app and that's whatsapp. About the 5th day of using the phone, I noticed that it began shutting down on its own, sometimes it restarts, most times it doesn't. Another issue is that the wifi keeps turning off on its own or just jumping off the internet. Also, the mobile data also spontaneously turns off by itself. Yes, that's 4 issues in just about 12 days of owning this phone. It has now become the bane of my existence! I am so frustrated with this phone, they don't even deserve 1/16th of a star! I will never purchase this phone ever again and I wouldn't want it even if I was being gifted one! I will also warn everyone I know not to purchase this phone, for the statisfaction they will receive from the reasonable price will surely be negated shortly thereafter with the range of issues that this phone has. I guess I will just have to dig deeper and purchase a more reliable phone that will undoubtedly cost me 4 times than what I paid for this, I felt like I wasted my $200. I am certain of one thing, an Alcatel phone will never be brought into my home again! People be warned.... Don't waste your energy, money or time, just save until you can get a better phone, one with warranty and some accountability on the company's part and most importantly never purchase a phone over Amazon. I am totally dissatisfied with the entire purchase as I also never received the Mr. shield screen protector and when I contacted them they told me to contact Amazon! I should have known this was a raw deal and returned everything! Alas, this will never ever happen again. Worst purchase ever!",0.0

I called Verizon and their tier 1 support tried to be helpful but the tier 2 support said ""we don't sell this phone try Google"". I traded a few emails with Google tech support until they said they had exhausted support options and recommended returning the phone.The replacement phone works well, I moved the SIM card from my old Droid Maxx, powered it up and both data and voice work on Verizon. I checked the bandwidth and it was good. Setup was a breeze, all my old apps and data were installed and I was able to uninstall the Verizon apps I never used. An Android 7.0 Nougat download was immediately available and installed without a problem.I like the size of the phone and the fingerprint reader on the back, it's easy to unlock and use the phone with one hand. The USB 3.0 connection charges the phone pretty quickly. The battery doesn't last as long as the Maxx but it makes through a whole day without charging.Not all of my contacts made the transfer, I had to export the contacts on my old Droid to a .vcf file in the internal memory, connect the phone to my PC, import the contacts on the GMail website, and then they synced on my phone.

Moto G Play (4th gen.) - Black - 16 GB - Unlocked,,149.0,4,"I had an LG G4 I bought at Verizon for $600 that failed after thge manufacturer warranty expired. I had one time opportunity to add the insurance for $12/month when the phone failed, so I did. Filed a claim, only to discover I now had a $150 deductable on top of the premium plus the $250 left to pay the phone off.WRONG.A family member suggested the Moto G4 Play & I am glad they did. I chose the $99 option with ads. You get Amazon Daily Deals on the lock screen. I look at those pretty much daily anyway, so they don't bother me at all. If they are an issue, for $30 more, you can get the ad free option. So i got a brand new smartphone for $100 instead of $150 deductable + $12 monthly premium for a refurbished phone with an out of date operating system...this wss a no-brainer.This phone is pretty incredible. The battery life blows my LG and Samsung Note 2 out of the water! I was having to charge my LG a couple of times a day. The Moto G4...one charge tests me thru most of the day, which is huge. I am no linger tethered to the charger!The graphics & screen resolution are amazing! It pretty much offers everything I want & need in a smartphone. There are a few issues that I'm no it thrilled with & they are the reason I rated itn4 stars vs 5: 1. The ringtone selection is not great. I am as but hard of hearing. I need a loud ringtone to hear the phone tpringing in my purse. There is one preloaded ringer that works. I can probably download one, just haven't had a chance. 2. Customizing the display, waapaper & home screen leaves a little to be desired. Again, downloading better options is probably the way to go. 3. The preloaded Amazon app is choppy & laggy. 4. Don't like the keyboard. It is not alphanumeric. You have to switch between alpha, numeric & symbol screens, which slows you down. 5. Still can't figure out hoiw to set up voicemail. 6. Accessories aren't easy to find. I wanted an Otterbox Defender case because I drop things due to a nerve disease. Ottorbox doesn't offer any cases for the Moto G4 Play.All in all, the benefits FAR outweigh the drawbacks & after factoring in the cost, it was the easiest decision I've made in a long time. Buy the Moi to G4 Play with confidence. You won't be sorry.",5.0

Apple iPhone 5c 32GB (Yellow) - AT&T,Apple,224.77,1,"I believe I was purchasing a new - not refurbhished item. However, the phone has been problematic since it was activated.

I took it to a recommended repair shop and the technician suggested that the battery could be bad. Upon opening the phone to change the battery, he discovered a somewhat bloated battery - indicating that it had probably been wet at one time. (I can attest that the phone has never been dunked!) He also said that ""stickers"" inside the case indicate that the phone was a refurbished one. I had never had it serviced before and as said, I thought I was buying a new phone. When I ordered, there was no indication to say it was not anything but new. Upon notifying the seller that I received a used/refurbished rather than a new phone, I received a canned reply that basically said I had 30 days from purchase to return the phone - a totally unsatisfactory answer.

I wanted a phone that would be comparable with an international sim card in addition to my US sim card. I read the various reviews on amazon before purchasing the phone. Therefore, I was not surprised when the start-up language on the phone I purchased was in Russian. (The instruction books came in two languages. I do not know what the second language was.) The language issue was easily resolved by an internet search on steps to set up the phone. The language is changed before the set-up process starts. I was able to return to the first screen in the set-up process in order to change the language setting. Once the language was changed set-up was easy without any additional help. The programming on this version of the phone seems to be slightly than that of the on-line demonstration phone, at least as to the set-up.

Verizon LG enV3 VX9200 No Contract 3G QWERTY MP3 Camera Cell Phone Red,LG,18.22,3,"It's fair. When I first received the phone, the front screen/display sounded like it was clicking and moving when I pressed it to my ear to talk on the phone. It was pretty distracting. It could be pushed and didn't seem securely fastened, but I really needed a phone, so I didn't return it. After a month of use, the front display kept falling off & even got lost for a few days. When I found the lost piece, I used Gorilla Glue to put it back on and it has stayed...and the clicking has stopped. I've used similar style phones for 10 years, and this one does the job...texting and calling, but I'm just not impressed with the quality at all. I've had it about six months and I'm going to use it a while longer...but I'll be happy when I feel like I can justify replacing it. If you have other choices in the same price range, I'd choose another. I had a Samsung Intensity before this phone and the overall quality was much better.

I declined and did research and found a code to type in to the dialer that fixed some of my problems in 5 minutes. When plugging this phone into a computer to transfer files they have turned a very simple process complicated. The special cord for the phone that is supposed to Conserve battery life was extremely buggy when I plugged into my computer. I had to use another phone's USB cord Just to get the phone to quit glitching out. This is the worst phone I have ever used So much so that I will not be using LG Smart phones any longer.

It is unlocked though as I put my Tmobile SIM card in it and it works.

"BLU Studio 5.3 S Unlocked Dual Sim Phone with Quad-Core 1.2GHz Processor, Android 4.1 JB, 5.3-inch IPS High Resolution Display, and 8MP Camera (Black)",CT-Miami LLC,150.0,1,"Let me first say that I'm not trying to give BLU a bad name, nor am I trying to pitch any other brand despite my last comment on this thread, but frankly I have to be honest. So, please excuse me if none of my comments are ""constructive"".I have owned various makes: iphone, kyocera, htc, lg, and more recently blu. I purchased the BLU Studio 5.3S because it was being sold/produced by a company based in the USA, and presumably ""Made in..."" too. Needless to say, I have not been at all impressed. In fact, I've been underwhelmed!I had an issue with this particular model's board after only a month or so of use. One day suddenly, it would not power on at all. I immediately reached out to BLU's technical support, and the response time from them was lacking. They had virtually no support queue, and when the line rang, it rang, and rang, and rang... I ended up having to reach out to BLU's business development team just to get a more prompt response.When I finally did get an RMA to return my device to BLU for support, they kept it for over a month. Ok, so maybe it was a subcontracted 3rd party, but really!?!?!?!There's more!The case enclosure is cheap. The buttons glued on horribly, and thin flimsy pieces of rubber not attached to the main chassis, but rather to the case itself. Zuh?!?!? Right side power button fell off after some time. I use a paper clip to lock and unlock my device. Embarrassing and cumbersome!The innards are cheap. The clasp that held the SD card fell off after a good three times opening and closing. (Perhaps I'm expected to leave that alone?)As far as its GPS radio, the signal constantly fluctuates in and out. I don't believe it's due to coverage. On several occasions I have had to toggle my WiFi and the Carrier Network just to get one running. Is there something wrong with the onboard radio receiver of this device? Could be me, but really!?!?!?!And maybe this is petty, but the accessories for this model are non-existent! Maybe that's why it's so darn cheap now, and has been pretty much erased from BLU's offerings. The blunder they want to forget. Clearly, this device was a failure. Sadly, I feel duped as a first-time customer. (I paid $220 for this paperweight. And considering the cost of the no-contract prepaid phone I needed while my BLU was being repaired, that would up my total cost for this phone at over $320. Should've gotten a Samsung!)Either way, the series of issues I have had with this have been very disappointing, discouraging, disenchanting... so much that I am not keen on touching BLU products ever again. I'll just stick with the standards. Sorry BLU, I really did try to like you.",0.0

"BLU WIN JR - 4.0"" Windows Smartphone - Global GSM Unlocked - Yellow",BLU,59.99,5,"For the price of $79.99, this smartphone exceeds my expectation (or is my expectation just very low?)First about the shipped item: off the box, the phone has had screen protector attached. Then BLU packed one more screen protector.Other items: back cover (transparent plastic), charger, earphone.The phone is loaded with Windows Phone 8.1.Once I removed the back cover (there is some 3mm little gap at the corner to pry the back cover), I can insert 2 SIM cards and micro SD card. Note that this phone accepts regular-size SIM card. If you have micro SIM card or nano SIM card, then you need adapter.I put one SIM card from Airvoice wireless and the other one connects to Lycamobile. FYI: Airvoice wireless uses AT&T network, while Lycamobile uses T-Mobile network. Both can connect to the networks instantly with no glitch.I need some getting used to the fact that there are 2 set of tiles for calling and SMS: one connects to SIM1 (in my case: Airvoice) and the other connects to SIM2 (in my case: Lycamobile).Body: covered with matte plastic. It's not as slippery as glossy surface. The feel of the body seems sturdy.The power button (on the right side of the body with the screen facing user) feels hard to press. This may be good or bad.The volume button (on the left side of the body) has similar behavior.Touch screen: with screen protector attached to the glass, I can feel that the touch screen is not as responsive as the Lumia phones that I have had. It needs slightly longer touch to make the software aware of the touch. It may be bothersome some times, however, once I use the swype, the touch screen feels good.Network connection performance: according to the screen, I could get 4G with Airvoice. I don't test the speed per se, however, it seems comparable with my Lumia 521.Performance: I use this phone primarily to read emails. So I don't have games on it. Switching from app to app is as smooth as Lumia 521.All in all, this is a very good value smartphone, considering it is unlocked and can accept 2 SIM cards.Update Jan 23, 2015: I used this phone to broadcast music in my car through Aux input. With this phone, the result is better than Lumia 521.Update Feb 4, 2015: The power button is on the right side while the volume button is on the left side, exactly across the power button. This creates some awkward result. Whenever I want to press the power button, I would accidentally press the volume button also. Many times this would result the OS to capture the screen.",6.0

"HP iPaq 6945 Unlocked Cell Phone with Wi-Fi, GPS, MP3/Video Player, SD--U.S. Version with Warranty (Silver)",HP Handheld,99.0,4,"I've had the 6945 for about two weeks now. So far it is performing very well. Setting up the email took a while to figure out. If you are like me, you hate all the clutter and useless software pre-installed on these devices, so it took me a while to clean up the view.I don't use the Outlook Sync function, but it looks like it works well. The auto-sync function is something to be aware of. The first time I did auto-sync it wiped-out my contact list on my PC and replaced with the few contacts on my sim card. Luckily it only deleted the contacts to my outlook delete folder so it was easy to restore. Here are some PROs and CONs after about two weeks of use:PRO:1) Wifi or Cingular GPRS email works well. You will have to set up two different accounts - one for your Wifi and another for when you are using GPRS, but that is easy to do. The reason you should do this is so that when you are on Wifi you can send via the Wifi server instead of the Cingular GPRS wireless network. I have set up both a work and personal home email account (both POP3). Looks like this device can handle several more email accounts if necessary.2) Internet explorer works very well. This is not a lame mobile web browser that strips down sites. It is the real deal. Websites look just like they do on your PC or laptop - only smaller. You can customize the view pretty easily. Favorites folder is easy to set up and the address bar is easy to use.3) The screen is very nice. I find myself using both the built in keyboard and the on screen touch pad. Both work very well. Resolution is very good.4) WM-5 is very nice. I've used the Work and Excel programs so far. They are essentially the same as on your PC. Why anyone would want to use an iPaq to edit a DOC or XLS file is beyond me, but if you need to do this you can. I have not had a chance to use the Powerpoint viewer yet, but I'm sure it works as well as Word and Excel.5) I purchased a 1GB mini-SD storage card. That is very easy to pop in and out.6) You can use MP3s or WMA files as your ring tone - that's pretty cool.7) The device is very solid. Not as big as you would think. Fits well in your pocket or on a belt clip. Looks like it will hold up well. The pen locks in the side and is also pretty solid. Not like the Treo, which I've heard is very fragile.8) And now for the Phone - It works very well! I was surprised because most people complain about the phone quality on these devices. I find the sound quality to be as good as my RAZR. The Cingular Sim-Card can be swapped in and out between my RAZR and iPaq, so if I am going to a sporting event or bar I and dont want to bring the iPaq I can just swap the sim-card right back into the RAZR and it works. I had to call Cingular and get them to change my phone to the iPaq. This was purely for data.9)YOU DO NOT NEED TO PURCHASE THE ""Treo Package"". Don't let Cingular sell you that extra crap. I simply added the MediaNet200 package for $19.99 which gives you unlimited Media + 200 text messages a month. That is plenty of text messages and the unlimited data gives you all the web surfing and emailing you can do!10) GPS navigation is pretty neat little function. You have to download the maps from Microsoft Pocket Streets, but they are free. The GPS sucks battery life like crazy, but if you are on the road in a strange city this can be very helpful.11) Windows Media player works just like your PC. I added about 750mb of music, so the device is actually an MP3 player as well. It has an external speak or you can stick in headphones (be aware, using the media player sucks battery life).CONS:1) I'd say the biggest con is the battery life. If you are on just GPRS/Phone with stand by (no talking, emailing or surfing) it will probably last about 2 days. However, using the phone or emailing cuts that down to about only 12-14 hours. If you set up the WiFi as well as have the phone on, your battery life is about 8-10 hours. If you also have the GPS and Bluetooth on, I'd say 5-6 hours. My advice is to not use the GPS or Bluetooth unless you really need them. And, if you are going to be on WiFi, leave the device in the craddle. The USB charging is very slow but the AC adapeter chargest the device to full in about 2 hours. YOU CAN PURCHASE A BIGGER BATTERY - and you probably should.2) Cingular does not support the 6945. You will have to tell them you have the 6925. I called HP - they are identical except that the 6925 is Cingular only and the 6945 is unlocked for T-Mobile as well. Obviously Cingular wants you to buy the 6925 instead, but the 6945 is the same. If you call Cingular for support, just tell them you have a 6925 to avoid even having to explain things to them.3) The ring volume is not that loud. But, it does have vibrate.4) Do not buy the leather case that Amazon sells with the device for like $[...]. The device comes with a belt clip that works just fine. If you want something nicer, go buy it in person....All in all this is an excellent device. I use to carry a cell phone and my laptop on the road - now all I need is this. Again, you can swap your sim-card in and out, so keep your old cell phone for times when you don't want to carry around the iPaq.I only gave it 4 stars because of the battery life. That can be fixed by purchasing the more powerful battery, but that will cost you extra. Also, the device is pretty expensive relative to the Treo or Q or Blackberry. None of those devices have WiFi though.",129.0

The user manual leaves a lot to be desired in terms of detailed instructions, but most of our questions were answered online anyway. There was a light-duty cover that came with the phone, but I had already gotten the heavier one recommended on Amazon. I've dropped the phone a couple of times with no damage occurring. As to the wrinkles....I couldn't text pictures until I went into the AT&T store, and they plugged in their password under the access point names setting. Then it was fine. I also noticed that using data is like a power-vacuum on the battery, it's dead in a couple of hours. But I don't use it often (only while traveling), and I try to limit/disable the apps to preserve the battery life. Talk and text alone will allow the battery to last 2 days in my experience.

Sony Xperia Z3+ (Z3 Plus) E6553 5.2-Inch 32GB Factory Unlocked Smartphone (Copper) - International Stock - No Warranty,,314.98,1,"Pros: * it looks really nice. I have received many complements for this phone from people (at least to me) * it feels very nice and it is pretty sturdy! I have dropped it many times but it still works and the screen is not shattered.Cons: * Don't buy this phone. The overheating issue is not something you can look over. It makes the phone literally unusable. Overheating causes this phone to slow down significantly to the point you want to scream. Any app that uses the CPU intensively slows down the phone. I will list the top apps that you practically can't use:1- Camera: YOU CANNOT USE THE CAMERA more than a minute or so. It becomes very unfortunate when you are recording a rare event (let's say a concert and your camera app shuts down because the phone is overheated. You cannot trust the camera for being quick and responsive either when your phone is hot. It takes a while to load and start working. 2- Maps (navigation): navigation is a CPU heavy process. That means it no camera or any other feature of your phone while that's happening. To be fair, you can make calls but the phone works so slow that it really goes on your nerves! 3- Snapchat: Snapchat is impossible to use on this phone. even if the phone is perfectly idle, Snapchat kills your phone. It makes your phone extremely hot in in tens of seconds and becomes unresponsive until. It's not to say you can't use it at all, it's just you have wait and be patient when you are using it. so if something is happening and you want to send a quick snap of that moment, you should forget about that! Even worse, if you connect your phone to a charger and open Snapchat your phone gets hot in no time and although the charger is still connected you battery percentage keeps slowly going down. 4- Skype: it's like Snapchat but a little better. You can't really use skype and multi-task. Skype alone is very heavy on the phone.",0.0

Studio 7.0 LTE - Smartphone - GSM Unlocked - Grey,BLU,,4,"I have a love hate relationship with this phone. It's really big! It's nice to do things on cuz of the size but it's just too big to put anywhere. There are no cases that I have really found for it. I ordered a case and it's the size of a tablet case with a skinnier slot for the phone to fit in. It is really awkward to have to pull out a tablet case and talk on it when u are walking around the grocery store. The lock button is easily pressed and when held down shuts off the phone. I have had it in my purse and get pressed and my phone shuts off without me knowing. This phone has to be rebooted daily or the phone starts freezing up and running really slow. Twice my phones screen has turned black and no buttons worked. I held down the power a couple of times and eventually it restarts and works again. I do not always get the texts people send me. I believe that is because of the phone and not my service because that never happened with my other phone. Overall it is not a bad phone though. It does what it is supposed to and I have only had these problems a few times. Just enough to be annoying but not enough for me to say it's a bad phone. You get what u pay for. It's a cheap phone and there is no way it is going to be a great as an iPhone or a Samsung. My favorite things about this phone are: the screen is very bright, the camera quality is pretty good on this phone, the volume on this phone is great compared to other blu phones, it's perfect size for watching movies or reading Kindle books.

Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty),Sony,199.99,4,"I bought this as a phone for my kid. It has served its purpose well enough.Pros:- Not too big (it's getting hard to find a 5"" screen anymore).- Waterproof (though we haven't tested it much, we have accidentally spilled liquid on it and it didn't break).- Reasonable specs.- Android Marshmallow 6.0.1 update recently released (installed it through Sony's Xperia Companion PC application).- Good support for AT&T and T-mobile frequency bands (including 3G AWS and LTE band 12, which are not easy to find)- SD card support.Cons:- Camera is not great.- Sony firmware is not great (have run into various ridiculous bugs -- like Google voice not working with Sony's dialer, and the front camera not working -- and it has been slow to update, though the latest firmware seems to work well).- No option for more than 16GB internal storage.- Have to jump through hoops to use adoptable storage in Sony's released Android Marshmallow 6.0.1 firmware.I paired this with a PNY U3 Turbo Performance 32GB SD card (which I think cost ten bucks when I got it). With the Marshmallow update, I am using the SD card as adoptable storage, and as the storage backing the /storage/emulated/0 space (so it is the default spot for pictures, app data, etc). Sony's released firmware doesn't totally support this, so you have to enable it using ADB, which is annoying, but not a killer. I have the card formatted 70/30 between adoptable and portable storage, because the Sony camera app doesn't like the SD card being the default internal storage. The storage space reported in settings->storage also is a little wonky. But other than that, it works fine. Performance in the adoptable storage setup is fine.With the adoptable storage setup, I now have enough free space in the default media storage location use Google's camera app (since for whatever reason Google hates SD cards, and so their camera app has no option to save to SD). Google camera seems to capture better images than Sony's built-in one.UPDATE Oct 2016: Sony released a new firmware version for this phone. Nothing super exciting (the only thing I noticed was that the android security patch level went from Apr 2016 to Jul 2016). But I thought it was worth mentioning that even though Sony has said there will be no new Android versions released for this phone, that it still released an updated firmware package with security patches.",0.0

"POSH MOBILE TITAN PRO HD ANDROID GSM UNLOCKED DUAL SIM 5.5"" HD SMARTPHONE EXTRA-large HD display, 13MP Camera and 8GB of Storage. 1 Year warranty. (Model#: E550 WHITE)",Posh Mobile,97.99,5,"While I've only had this a few days, so far it's far better than I expected. A few notes about some issues users report.1. The phone as of 2016-05-18 did NOT work on metropcs, so save your time, at least not in my area. T-Mobile and ATT are fine. I believe some of the entries on amazon say it works on metropcs, that's incorrect. It will work on any network that accepts unlocked GSM phones.2. The usb charger is not hard to work around, all you have to do is take a standard length microusb plug, take a hardware store razor blade, and slice away at an angle from the plastic connector down to the metal part, it's really not difficult, and there's no need to worry about having the slightly longer included cable, I just cut away at about a 45 degree angle and a standard cable fit fine. The case is at a slight angle where the connector meets the body, so that side can be cut away slightly more than the other. Without this cable mod, the connection was erratic using a standard usb cable, with it, it's fine.3. Standby battery life is quite good, but when you use it for anything, the battery drains fast, but that's why it only weighs 52 grams, you can't expect a tiny battery to have a long life, that's not realistic.This little phone is amazing, they've actually managed to cram a full android smart phone onto the device. Typing on it is delicate since the key icons are so tiny, but you actually get the hang of it unless you have thicker fingers.In terms of size, this phone is literally about the same size as just the top lid part of an old flip phone I have.I can't think of a better phone for things like backpacking where you need to have a phone for rides etc, and for me, I prefer this small size, I almost never carry my full sized smart phone because I just don't like that size.I won't know for a year how durable this thing actually is, but honestly, at the price, I don't even care if it fails, you can buy 12 of these for every galaxy or iphone you buy, and they aren't nearly as adorable.",3.0
Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (CORAL RED) - International Stock No Warranty,Sony,404.99,5,"Long story short: this is the phone that finally convinced me to make the jump from Apple's iOS. I had been considering making the jump for some time, but I had yet to find an Android phone that matched the build quality and performance of my iPhone 6S. The z5 Compact finally did convinced me.Pros:+ Same size screen as the iPhone 6S, despite being smaller and lighter.+ Excellent build quality - the phone feels premium, solid and well made. I don't worry about anything breaking if I drop it once or twice.+ Waterproof!+ Very little manufacturer bloatware, especially compared to Samsung or LG. Among other things, this means that future Android updates will hit this phone sooner than many other Android devices.+ I actually most of the bloatware that's included. Sony's launcher is fast and responsive - I'm actually using it instead of the official Google launcher.+ Camera is high quality.+ Better battery life than my iPhone 6s+ Fingerprint scanner+ Plenty of processing power - I haven't yet seen the phone slow down or choke on any app I've thrown at it.Cons:- Cases options for this phone in the U.S. are limited when compared to the dancing plethora of iPhone cases that flood every electronics store, website, gas station and grocery store.- Because this is the international version of the phone, there's no warranty- Because this is the international version of the phone, some apps think I'm in Ireland. I'm sure a simple setting could easily change this, but I haven't yet found it.- Fingerprint scanner doesn't work as well as iPhone 6S (though it's still good). I think this is mainly due to the fact that the scanner is smaller than the iPhone scanner, so it has less to work with.Overall, I've found this phone to be the perfect fit for me. It really hits the sweet spot of combining the power, battery life, screen size and non-bloated OS that I've been looking for.",

I am totally impressed with it and believed that Nokia has come up with a winning product. I just owned this baby for less than a week but has already become addicted to it. Prior to buying e75, I have done research on various high-end phones on iphone, blackberrry, sony and even various other Nokia E-series and N-series phones and have also read almost all existing E75 cell-phone reviews on the web. Though there are mixed reviews on it, I decided to take the plunge and purchased it. Couldn't be happier with my purchase. It is definitely one of my best investments for the year, can't say the same for my other investments I have made :)===PROS1)Great great looks. stunning design. It is a really beautiful phone. I really liked a candy shaped smartphone that looks like a regular cellphone. Most of the powerful highend smartphone are much wider and have a bulky look. e75 has great dimensions and could easily fit inside a jeans pocket. great! The slide-out full-sized qwerty keypad is simply addictive! it is very easy to use, good-sized keys, slider makes a solid ""thud"" when opening and closing. amazing style and quality. love it!2)Amazing usability. In the first day, I already set up my email accounts(in a few simple clicks), browse the web, listening to both FM and internet radio, subscribe to podcasts, view office documents, download some latest apps from Nokia ovi store and use GPS as a tour guide. it is just so intuitive that I doubt you will need the guidebook and web reviews to guide you through using *any* features.3)Great build quality. It has a nice weight on it and feels like you are definitely holding something ""substantial"". I read about various people getting leaky keypad and such. No such issue with mine. As I said before, the sliding keypad feels very solid and snapping back and forth feels very secure with no loose ends. The silver-black and chrome combination makes e75 looks very upscale and all the keys are well-placed and very responsive. Some people are complaining about screen-size too small, qwerty layout hard to adjust etc. I find the screen size very sufficient to read email, browse documents and web. It is extremely sharp and is readable under bright sunlight and qwerty keypad works great. Can type out a long email in no time. Besides it also have a set of regular keys in front so you could do one-hand messaging as well. perfect!4)Good offering of applications. Web and office documents browsing and editing, great media player, easy to use GPS system makes it a fun-filled power business smartphone. A word about audio quality. The loudspeaker may not be as loud as someone likes but it is no worse than the samsung and motorola that I used to own. Call quality is superb. Reception is very good.===CONS1)Well, someone can quip about screen being too small, camera not being 5MP, screen not being the sharpest around, symbian too outdated, audio quality subpar, no touchscreen etc etc. but the ONLY complain that I think is valid and a very serious concern is the extensibility which may be what is stopping iphone users from crossing over. blame it on the App Store. Iphone is amazing not only because of its physical form and touch screen intuitiveness but on its amazing array of 3rd party applications. Sad to say, Nokia much touted ovi-store where we could purchase applications fall short, WAY short. I have browsed around for further-addon apps, very less offering and many are not free. well, even if they are free, i am not so sure i wanted them on. Don't even get me started on their Ngame platform. The games offering is simply pathetic. This lack of extensibility maybe crippling Nokia in the future where customers are very savvy and demanding and they want cellphones that have a long lifecycle and full of applications of anything imaginable not just what is offered by the manufacturer.2)A quick word about battery life. It really is pretty lousy, just as stated by various e75 review articles. You do need to charge it daily.3)I hate to state the obvious but the price tag is pretty hefty considering it didn't really offer any earth-shattering features that are not currently on the market or any out-of-the-world design.All in all, I am extremely happy with my purchase. As long as you are aware of the limiting factors, e75 is an extremely well-rounded smartphone with great style and substance. Nokia E75 is everything that a business person would want and need plus much more.** I recently run into a refresh bug where my screen keeps on refreshing itself indefinitely. You may trigger this bug when your phone is running out of battery, and while recharging, you press on your email icon. I think the auto-syncing of email go crazy when dealing with this particular usecase. You don't have to send the phone back to manufacturer or even reset your phone, there is a nifty solution where you just have to press Control Panel->Settings->General->Personalization->HomeScreenMode->ModeSettings->Email Notifications->Disable then restart your phone. Your beloved phone will be functioning again. Hope that helps!",13.0

(Model#: L530 GOLD)",Posh Mobile,152.99,2,"Not bad for the price, but not great either. This is my first android phone, and, coming from a Windows Phone, I absolutely love the OS and app selection. However, the phone seems to lag quite often just bouncing between common apps like Instagram, snapchat, and messaging. I don't do any gaming really or graphics processing, so I can't say anything about how it would handle that.Camera takes great pictures if it's on a tripod, but it's almost impossible to get a good, perfectly focused picture while holding it in your hand. Same applies to the front facing camera.The fingerprint reader location was initially odd, but I got used to it very quickly, and it actually works pretty well, but rarely on the first try (at least with the case on, I haven't tried it without the case on).The case that comes with the phone isn't bad at all - it's a very low profile silicone case with minimal protection, but it adds some grip to the phone. I don't believe there are any other cases available for this phone.BOTTOM LINE:I've had the phone for a few months now, and I'm itching to upgrade to something that runs smoother and faster. If this is your max budget, buy this phone for sure, but I would recommend spending more for a faster phone with a nicer camera if that's important to you.",

Once rooted don't do the wireless update. Like I did even after reading forum that advised against it. I soft bricked my phone. Which caused it to get stuct on a bootloader loop. Eg. Stuck on phone logo. Their are a lot of good tools on the net to reverse this problem if you understand the concepts. Unlike me I don't really understand the rooting process. Just wanted to be able to get browser apk to install. But anyways if you do get stuck on bootloader loop....

"BLU Studio 5.0 HD Unlocked Cellphone, White",BLU,119.99,3,"I have been using this phone for about a month now. I would start off by saying you get more than your money's worth with this phone. My favorite part is the camera. It is awesome. It is customizable to your personal preferences. However it may be a little fussy if you do not understand the ins and outs of digital camera settings. For me this was a dream! I can set the phone to the levels I want. I downloaded a photo editor to finish up my photos and there is nothing I cannot do. And what you get, for the price you pay, is fabulous. I am a penny pincher, and I simply cannot justify the cost of most celluar phones, concidering the life expetancy is two years. And the cost of other phones with compairable stats were $400 and up! I simply will not pay that much for a two year product. But I am very happy with my Blu.It is an android, but it is generic android os, so all the extra bells and whistles are not available, such as custom font size and such.But there are a few things I feel a person should be aware of before purchase. First, Blu customer service is known for being terrible, so be sure you purchase through an amazon backed company, because amazon will do you right where Blu will not. Second, this phone has a heat problem. To keep your product working and lasting, besure to down load an app, like clean master, to help you manage the heat problem. I also recomend you get a new screen protector and case for this phone. They did not include the case as promised and the scren protector covered the receiver and was imposible to hear a phone call without using speaker. The image quality was also greatly impeded by the quality of screen protector they provided. The apps crash more than I would like, but I am not sure if that is the phone or the os since I am transitioning from a windows phone to android. My windows phone did not crash nearly this much. The battery is kind of short lived, so you may want to get a battery bank too. Even though this seems like a lot of complaints, this is fairly fuss free so long as you have the heat problem monitored.",0.0

Coofone Ultrathin Credit Card Size Mini Cell Phone 2G GSM Mobile Phone Unlocked (Blue),"Quality Technology Industrial Co., ltd.",19.99,3,"The best place for calls is in a semi-quiet outdoor area. With the occasional car driving by or people or birds, it's still good. I found that indoors is quiet too, but the call cuts out routinely.It's a very cheap made piece of plastic, which is fine. It's so cheap that when you press a button the whole button interface bends a little because it's one plate for all the buttons. This is all fine and works well, but I would have hoped for better working components in exchange for cheap hardware.I bought a Ting sim card that matches the GSM capabilities described here, and with a little help from Ting was able to set it up easily. At one point the sim card went in way too far and was hard to get out, I shook the phone and knocked it on the side of a table. The ""door"" to the sim card came off, very cheap, but the card came out. As part of cheap hardware, I was able to reattach the phone door easily.The back of the phone does not come off, and it doesn't need to.At first it was frustrating figuring out all the settings, as it works like a flip-phone with limited buttons. It's very confusing but I kept clicking and it works okay now that I know how to use it.Overall, my opinion after trying out longer has gone up and I will likely keep it. I wanted a phone that does calls only, and this is the first one that has actually served that purpose.",0.0

BLU Tank II T193 Unlocked GSM Dual-SIM Cell Phone w/ Camera and 1900 mAh Big Battery - Unlocked Cell Phones - Retail Packaging - Black Blue,BLU,18.93,4,"Just so you know that all major phone carriers starting in Jan. 2017 will not operate phones with the Sim card-If you are looking for a phone that is for emergencies or one that has NO INTERNET ACCESS this one is great. You do get what you pay for- this phone is lightweight and made of a thin plastic- but it does not appear or look that way unless you hold it and look closely. It texts and receives calls just fine. The only time it can be a pain is when a smartphone sends it an icon, picture, or video (this phone will not receive any of them). Picture quality is also grainy. However for an emergency phone what you want it to do is call and text. Plus if you want a phone with no internet (which is very hard to find) this model will do the trick and not look dorky (just know that it lacks the bells and whistles of today's cell phones. However, this can be a great quality if it is your normal phone because you will not be glued to it all the time.I also suggest the yellow color- it was the coolest looking in my opinion for this model of phone.",1.0

Unnecto Air 4.5 - Unlocked (White),Unnecto,69.99,3,"I'm hoping I might get my issue resolved through an RMA replacement. I bought the grey 4.5 Air in Feb'16. Loved it. Love it still, other than a SIM pin may have gotten bent as the SIM chip was being removed to dry the phone after its swim ( ...like it's never happened to you...) Dried it off as well as possible, popped it into a bag of rice for 2 days and voila, all data intact, apps work, WIFI works... but it won't make calls, only 911s, and won't text. I expect this is the SIM platform, what actually holds the chip. Also will not synchronize the proper time, date or year.So I bought a white 4.5 Air to replace it, and THIS one is just as great EXCEPT it does not get mobile data and my carrier confirmed I *AM* paying a flat rate for my mobile data. The phones are precisely the same model, just different color backs. But the white may have had, or did not have, an upgrade which woud have made it unequal to the grey phone. I can come back after whatever happens with the white phone happens and give another review on their customer service.",1.0

BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Smartphone - Unlocked - Orange,BLU,115.0,5,"*Just in case Amazon is combining reviews with other models, this is for the Blue Studio 5.0 C HD D535U, Yellow, for $119. This model is 8 GB storage with radio bands best for the United States with HSPA+ up to 42 MBPS speeds. The D534U is 4 GB storage with radio bands best for the United States with HSPA+ up to 21 MBPS speeds. The D534L has radio bands better for international countries. I'm not certain of the storage or data speeds.*For reference I am coming from 2 years use of a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 & 1 year use before that of a Samsung Galaxy S 2.*Responsiveness -I haven't noticed any lagging. Again, I bought the 8 GB. I have my Samsung Class 10 32 GB micro SD card installed. I would even say it's slightly more responsive than my Note 2. I don't do any gaming. I check email, browse the internet, shop, edit Google Docs & Sheets, etc, and of course make phone calls & send receive sms/mms.*Data speeds - If you're experiencing slow data speeds, do not rely on the automatically configured settings when inserting your SIM. Check with your carrier for the proper settings. My phone displays 4G. I have not noticed slower speeds compared to LTE on my previous phone. This may be due to the responsiveness of the processor.*Sound & volume - Speaker volume is just fine for calls. I don't have anything negative to say. For watching videos, I've needed to turn it down slightly.*Fits well in my smaller hands. It can definitely be used one handed with no modifications. Lighter weight.*Screen viewing for videos, texts, & pictures is fine. No issues. I was concerned about the slightly smaller screen from my Note 2 (5.5 to 5.0), but it's no adjustment at all.*Color is a neon yellow, not like a banana yellow, but not like glow in the dark neon. It's a nice looking phone.*Accessories - The box it came in is plastic & really nice. The case, headphones, & charger are all adequate. I installed the screen protector (bubbles underneath from dust but that's not Blu's fault) & it doesn't take away from the quality of the screen.*Keyboard - I did have to download the Google Keyboard from the Play Store to get gesture typing. Not a problem at all.*Camera - I use a DSLR for my main camera, but I do want my phone to have a capable camera. Lots of settings or just use auto scene detection. Definitely not as good as my sister's iPhone 6 & maybe not as good as my Note 2, but I would feel comfortable printing out 4x6 prints taken with this phone.*Durability - I dropped it on black asphalt the first day. I was very disgusted. Screen did not crack. I do see a small pin dot size chip, but I can't feel it when I run my finger over it. There is a black, plastic bezel around the screen which ended up with a minor chip that can't be seen when holding the phone at an arm length distance & can not be seen with the case on.*Battery life - I am not having the battery life issues others have had. I do plug it in when I'm home & not directly using it. There is battery left over at the end of the day, & I fully charge it overnight.*Bottom line - I just really can't find anything to complain about with this phone. I wasn't expecting much for $119 but I think it's as good as my Note 2 that costs me $550 2 years ago. My daughter is wanting a new phone when she heads to college in the fall. Her Samsung Galaxy S Relay has slowed down significantly even with 2 factory resets. I'm encouraging her to look into one of these instead of spending several hundred on another Samsung.",52.0

I love the WP8 OS, and I've been using it since over a year and have had no trouble on any of my devices with Microsoft Updates/Manufacturer updates, etc.This phone arrived just on time, but I immediately noticed the box was not an HTC box. It was a generic box. With self-printed sticker on the box indicating it's an HTC phone. The box contained charger, phone, the sim-card-insert-pin/clip, headphones. No manuals.Also noticed that the screen-protector was not original -- it seemed someone may have removed the original and placed a new phone without much care - and left many streaks/air-bubbles etc.Nonetheless, I turned on the phone, activated it and setup using Outlook account. And phone restarted suddenly -- there was no windows update or anything. I thought may be I did something. I checked through Setup also, and it showed there were no update available. Phone remained on for couple of hours and then it would continue restarting every 2-3 minutes, to a point where it completely died. I could not power it ON.I returned the phone and received the full refund.My opinion of this *particular shipment*: This phone either was not an original HTC, or it was a refurb. Either way, HTC / 8x / WP8 are have never given me trouble until this phone. So again, the problem must be with this particular inventory item.Here is my review of Lumia 620: http://www.amazon.com/review/R22ZF0XAEUDTLL/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FP2PE22&linkCode=&nodeID=&tag=",2.0
Nextbit Robin Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone - Mint (U.S. Warranty),,249.99,4,"Coming from the Moto G3 8Gb version, the Robin was an overall upgrade for me. To make a long story short, I love this phone. All the extra memory, the smooth day-to-day performance, the latest OS and whatnot makes for an enjoyable experience. Plus I still get asked what kind of phone this is, more than a month after owning it. It looks good.That being said, I have only two real criticisms. The phone runs noticeably warm when charging and running thing like GPS/Pokemon Go, or while it downloads updates and you're still surfing or using Facebook. I've also noticed by the volume rocker a crease in the body-- a very small one-- which can only mean that the phone is starting to succumb to bending. I take care of my phone and I don't wear tight pants or anything, so it's just a heads up to future buyers.I do still recommend the Robin for anyone looking for a new phone or just something different. A very solid 8/10 for me.",9.0

I was maxing out the storage capacity with apps and photos on the Exhibit 4G, even though I used an SD card, it started getting a little glitchy and needing me to frequently clear cache, etc. So, I gave the Exhibit to my 13 yr old daughter who appreciates the front facing camera and is satisfied with it for texting and social apps, watching video, etc., all on Wi-Fi, as she has no data plan. Then, it got stolen from her and because it offers a lot for the price, we replaced it with the same phone (purchased on Amazon). I sure am glad I didn't spend more for her phone because she has since dropped it and cracked the screen. Fortunately, the crack isn't that bad and the phone still works great.

So far so good.Now when I transferred the sim card from my other phone, it came on nicely. But when I decided to make a call, it dialed once, then aborted. There was no signal bars. I even went outside on the road and tried dialing again to no avail. My wife then tried calling it with the home phone and it responded but did not ring, just vibrated even though I had set a ring tone.This was too much, because it was supposed to be a birthday gift for my wife.

She said that Samsung has a good life span, it good quality for the money, and this phone does all that I need. I love the size, I can easily see the pictures, and they are very clear on this phone. The font size can be easily changed. So that helps this poor old half blind woman! I haven't found anything about it that I don't like. It's not too big, yet large enough you can see it well, and still fit in your hand. My daughter showed me a lot of the features I was not aware of, and where to find stuff, so that was helpful. I figured out how to get my contacts, and how to take photos, and sent texts all by myself! Woohoo! So it is user friendly.

Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty),Sony,304.14,4,"This is a good phone, but if possible get yourself a Z3 Compact instead. Despite the spec sheets you will see that claim that Qualcomm's newer processor is faster than the one in the Z3, the Z5 runs notably slower and hotter. Not that the Z5 is slow, just that I had the Z3 for over a year without experiencing any of the tiny lag hiccups I get with the Z5, nor did I ever notice any heat coming off the Z3 despite its slimmer size. The heat in particular makes me nervous about how well the Z5 will stand the test of time. There are some very minor design elements that are nice on the Z5, like the matte finish on the back and the position of the buttons/ports, but in my opinion these features aren't worth the slight decrease you get in performance.",1.0

I tested the Android system after purchasing the Nexus 4 phone. It was horrible, the batter lasted 2 hours max, the OS and Android Apps were ugly, difficult and buggy. What a mess. I sold it after great frustration and hardware issues. I purchased this International Un-locked version of the Nokia 920. Wow. Windows OS is awesome, flawless, fast, fun and live. The set up is intuitive, and Apple can't beat the integrated, speedy sexy look and operation. This is an awesome product. I know there are thinner and even more sleek Nokia and other Window phones out there now, but I have this one and I am sold. My iPhone has less than a year and it will be buried next to my Newton. Steve Jobs has passed and Apple in my view has peaked. Congrats Microsoft, this is a winnner and fun all the way.",1.0
LG Nexus 5X Unlocked Smartphone with 5.2-Inch 32GB H790 4G LTE (Carbon Black),LG,399.0,4,"UPDATE - I increased one star after months of usage; see below for more details.Ok... This is my honest review. First, the phone looks awesome. I like it is light and it is fast enough during normal usage. Screen looks incredible (compared to my old HTC One M8 GPE). Camera is great; really really great. Fingerprint reader works fast and it is very accurate. The speaker (single mono speaker) is kind of bad... maybe I have been spoiled by the HTC ONE M8 boomsound (stereo and very loud speakers), but at least they do the job. Now, I pay a lot of attention to the audio output with headphones and, even though the volume is a lot softer than the M8, the quality is actually pretty good. I use a pair of Shure SE425 and they work really well with the phone. Lots of details and very nice response for music (mainly Heavy Metal, Jazz, and Latin/Salsa genres).Now, the bad part... The first thing I noticed was the Light sensor... It is bad. It goes high and goes low all of a sudden, no smoothness in decreasing or increasing the brightness of the screen. You can turn it off and manually adjust the brightness, but it could be really challenging adjusting the brightness in direct sun light. Next, the phone stopped charging without any reason! It just stopped. After moving the cables from one side to another it started charging again. All of a sudden, it stopped again... One has to play with the cable in order to get it working. I contacted LG about this and they informed me that the phone did not have ANY WARRANTY in the USA. I bought the phone directly from AMAZON.COM it even the instruction booklet states the warranty is for USA. After closer examination of the phone, I also found a huge dead pixel. I pushed LG until they agreed in honoring the warranty. The screen was replaced after 1 week of repair time frame and it came back with a RED SCREEN of DEATH. I have to manually install the ROM via SDK Tools (unlocking the bootloader and using Fastboot prompts) in order to get it working again... VERY VERY BAD LG!!!! Next I noticed the screen has a lot of light bleeding at the top. I had to sent it back once again... In addition, the vibration motor is very noisy (in silent environments it bothers people around you) and the battery life is weak (so far, it lasts a lot less than the M8).In general, I am fan of Google Nexus line, but this one did fail for me. Lg did not pay attention to small details in this phone. Audio could be a lot louder, the speakers could have been stereo, and that light sensor... it might be fixable via software update, but I do not think it will happen considering Google usually ignores these ""minor"" issues. In general, I am very disappointed with the phone despite it is not a bad phone, this is more about the details more than the core of the phone. I ordered the Nexus 6p and I will be comparing these two soon. If you order this, try to do it from the Google Play Store or directly from AMAZON and check the warranty with LG as soon as you get the phone... but so far, it seems to me LG does not pay attention to any details in terms of construction and warranty fulfillment!UPDATE - 04-10-16Well, after months of usage it has gotten better after normalization of usage. Watching videos will kill your battery, it has a poor battery life for watching videos. So, if you like to use your phone as a media powerhouse, keep the original charger around with you; it charges very fast! Last software update (March, build MHC19J) improved the phone overall performance. I am very happy with it now.Compared to the Nexus 6p, it is a very capable phone. I did not notice any significant difference in overall performance (even before March update). I sold the N6p due its size; it is too big for me. In addition, I really prefer the N5X LCD screen against the AMOLED. But, the real deal breaker for me with the N6p was the audio. The N5X has a lot better audio than the 6P through the 3.5mm output jack. It is a shame that the ""premium"" phone has such a poor audio experience! The 6p has an aluminium body and feels heavier, but the N5X feels very solid and I frankly prefer lighter phones. Nexus 5X is a 4 star if you get a working phone (I had to send it for warranty two times, but now it is good) and if you ignore small details (no stereo speakers and a very annoying vibration module; I turned off almost every vibration feedback of the UI). For $380 it is a 3.5 star phone, for $350 it becomes a 4 stars... $300 is a steal (32gb version that is... 16gb is a no go for me!).",3.0

BLU PURE XL Smartphone - 4G LTE GSM Unlocked - 64GB +3GB RAM - Gold,BLU,134.95,5,"(Updated 02/17/2016 after a small update from Blu.)When you hear the words ""Flagship Model Phone"" you immediately assume you going to be dealing with the best a manufacturer has to offer. This is definitely the case with the Blu Pure XL. While Blu hasn't made the world's best phone with the Pure XL, it most certainly has made a phone worthy of the title ""best phone at or under $350."" Blu has certainly walked the line between cost and performance, but anybody that picks up the Pure XL will probably agree that's its well worth $350.Some are afraid Blu won't update this phone, but they have already been proven wrong! Blu has released at least one OTA update so far.I give this phone 5/5 stars. It has its flaws, but the combination of price and features more than makes up for the flaws.The Great:+ Great big 6"" SAMOLED screen with excellent color and good brightness. Very sharp graphics on its 2560x1400pxl screen despite being a pentile aray.+ Fast and snappy processor, 8 64bit cores @ 2.0ghz provide excellent multitasking and great media playback.+ 64GB of internal memory provides more space than your average person will probably ever need.+ Micro SD slot supporting a 64GB SD card (128gb reported working great) for those power users that need more space.+ USB OTG capable port.+ Rapid charging via included 9/5v 2a charger. Rapid charges from 0%-75%, slows down above 75%+ NFC, includes 3 tags to get you started.+ dedicated camera button, that behaves like a normal camera button. Half press for focus, full press to shoot.+ 24mpxl back facing camera, 8 mpxl front facing camera. Optical Image Stabilization (OIS).+++ Long exposure up to 12 seconds!!! That's almost unheard of in a phone camera!+ Ultrapixel mode for 119 megapixel shots! Actually works great for a software resolution boost.+ Records videos in the new HEVC/H265 video codec.+ Has a pro camera mode that allows you to take you shots exactly the way you want.+ Capacitive hardware buttons.+ Covers GSM, CDMA, HSDPA, and EDGE networks. (Verizon will not let you put this phone on their network, even via straight talk.)+ Nice loud speaker on the rear.+ Double tap to wake.+ Multifunction fingerprint scanner on back.+ Lots of accessories in the box, includes its own flip cover leather case, a free poly carbonate case, free OTG adapter, and free screen protector and a pair of really high quality earbuds with built in mic and volume buttons.+ 4k video recording.Par for the course:- 3GB of RAM is neither bad nor great, more than enough for most, but flagships from other manufacturers are offering 4GB.- Supports all WiFi modes, includes dual band. Nothing special.- ""Smart gestures"" for added functionality, but not terribly useful. Includes eye tracking for keeping the display lit.- 3500mAH battery could be better, provides 5-7 hours of active use.- Interesting but unimpressive settings menu layout.- Quick settings divorced from the pull down notifications slider. Now found in its own customizable slider hidden at the bottom of the screen. Can be semi customized by holding the icons and dragging them to different positions.The bad:x Capacitive buttons don't have a backlight. Hard to use in anything but good lighting.x No HDMI out. Can only cast the screen via WiFi.x Severe lack of third party phone cases.x Non replaceable battery compounds issues with short battery life.x Built in home screen is a joke, almost certainly needs to be replaced by the end user.x Camera quality is a bit muddy when fully zoomed in.x Missing a few LTE bands (notably band 12 for T-Mobile).x Lack of customization for the flip cover screen. Flip cover has a view port, but only 5 backgrounds to choose from and no other customization options. Makes one wonder why the view port was left open and not a whole price of clear plastic since there is usually nothing worth pressing in the view port.",6.0

I had to purchase an OEM battery and that did the trick.However, for whomever is thinking about purchasing this phone be warned, it heats up when using the default camera app, like a lot! If you try to use the video camera is even worse since the app shuts down after 10 seconds (even if you are not recording!) I had to get a different camera app because of that, and so far I havent found one with the 1080p60fps option, only 30fps. Its a big shame really being a powerful phone and having this design issues.

Cons for me was I thought I was getting a gsm AT & T phone but it was Tmobile. Not sure if that's the issue or not. I couldn't really disable the apps. The phone itself is good but I returned it for a full refund & have ordered a different note4. Cons...Amazon.com super fast refund and easy returns. They never disappoint me and deliver just what they promise!!! I'm satified overall!!",3.0

Even that would've been okay if the phone was indeed unlocked as the seller claims, however the phone I received was not. I paid for an unlocked phone but got a LOCKED phone.

I bought the phone in October of 2015. It performed perfectly and I have been thrilled with the phone. In November of 2016 I contacted AT&T to have the phone unlocked. It seems there was still a balance owed on the phone. From AT&T: ""You have not completed all the payments for your device according to your AT&T Next service agreement."" So they won't unlock it.I contact the seller and I get this:""This phone was purchased over 395 days ago. We ask to be contacted within our 30 day return policy for any issues you encounter with the device. We are unable to assist you with unlocking this phone.Thank you,Kiley""Okay, I get it, I've owned the phone for a year. But do I own it or not? Why would they sell me a phone with a balance on it? One can speculate on how they acquired it or whether they cared to check to see if there was a balance on it, or whether they cared. I contacted customer service. While well intentioned, they seemed to not truly understand the problem and every email sent to me from them had a different foreign name on the signature and it seemed like the left hand didn't know what the right was doing. After I finally called and spoke to someone in person, also clearly not an English first speaker, they did send the seller a message telling them to refund me the money and a tag for returning the phone.No dice. The seller is stonewalling now. In one of the emails between myself and Amazon they offered me a one time $100 certificate so I guess I'll accept that and shut up. Still there seems to be no consequences for the seller, MyWit, selling a phone with a balance owed on it. Doesn't seem right to me. Do what you will with this info, folks.Great phone though.",0.0

"Nokia N73 Unlocked Smartphone with 3.2 MP Camera, 3G, MP3/Video Player, MiniSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)",Nokia,199.0,1,[Note: my review is not about the seller but the device]I will not repeat every comment others made but I will say this: it works on the right frequency for high speed data if you DON'T live in the US. If you live in the US this phone is not for you. In addition (and possibly not coincidentally) this phone will eventually get into a mode where it will drain all the battery as it keeps talking to the network trying and failing to receive SMS. So you get no SMS and you soon (within hours) have a dead phone. I sent it in twice to Nokia (at my own expense) to get it fixed while it was under warranty but both times the problem re-appeared within days. Needless to say Nokia doesn't care - in fact their comment over the phone was that this device seems incompatible with my carrier! So much for US version.

I also have the LG V10 and the Moto G4 Plus and have been using this one daily since I received it.Pros:For the specs, this was priced incredibly well. This phone has the specs of a flagship for the cost of a mid-range phone.I really dislike gold phones but this one isn't a gaudy gold color. It's softer and has grown on me over the past month+ I've been using it.The screen is clear and easily seen in bright sun. This is one thing that I struggled with when using my V10. I hated having to turn the brightness up just so I could see my screen outside.Audio is loud and clear.Fast charging. This has come in handy more than once!Cons:I do wish the LED notification light was customizable. There are only 2 colors, red and green so there is no way to set different colors for specific notifications.I really dislike the on screen buttons because they're so close together. I can't tell you how many times I've hit the home button when I thought I was hitting the back button.

NOKIA 301.2 FACTORY UNLOCKED QUADBAND 3G 850/1900 WORLD PHONE - BLACK,Nokia,269.1,3,"The phone is of high quality and connected fine in 2G mode, but would not connect in 3G mode with my AT&T cellular service in Maryland, USA. The reason became apparent when I discovered that the 301.1 version was sent with a non-mfg label over mfg label stating it was 301.2. The manufacturer label (and label under battery cover - see photos) showed clearly that this was the 301.1 version, which has 900/2100 WCDMA and will not allow 3G on AT&T in the USA. I returned it less then 2 hours after opening it since the sole reason I purchased the phone was because AT&T is dropping 2G service in my area by the end of 2016, and it seems they have already been decommissioning 2G on some towers as my coverage has gotten worse on my 2G-only cell phone. Both sellers using Amazon fulfillment appear to be shipping the 301.1 version instead of the 301.2 version described on the product page - this is evidenced by the user reviews. Buyer beware - this phone will not provide 3G service in the USA!",10.0

BLU Vivo Air LTE Factory Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White,BLU,429.99,4,"I've been using this phone for a little over a week on the AT&T GoPhone service and I'm quite impressed on what $150.00 gets you with a phone these days. Let's not be coy, Blu is an American company sure, but this device is most definitely a rebranded Chinese phone. Even still the build quality is far more than acceptable for the price. Coming from the Samsung Galaxy Alpha this Vivo Air LTE does everything the Alpha did, but it's a lot thinner (hard to imagine considering the dimensions of the Alpha), lighter, just as good a screen, and the camera is about as good, though less mp at 8 rather than 12. All at about half the price the Alpha currently goes for...used at over a year old.Pros: Price, Screen, build, feel in hand, camera, weight, thinness (personal opinion), performance, and nearly stock Android which is refreshing coming from a Samsung device.Cons: 16GB memory, no SD card slot, lowlight camera performance (like most phones), and the back glass appears to scuff easily so I highly recommend a clear protector before you begin using it (I personally can't stand phone cases).Conclusion: No doubt the form factor amd looks of this phone make it stand out. A few people have said its what the iPhone 4s would probably look like if it were built today, that's a pretty solid compliment in my opinion. If you're looking for an unlocked phone (maybe to get out from under a carrier) around this price I can't imagine a better deal. Definitely recommend.",2.0

Huawei Ascend Mate 7 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Smartphone with 13MP Camera - Black,,264.77,5,"INTRODUCTION :Buying a new phone can be one of the most difficult decisions a person can make. I spent months searching and researching for a new cellular device that I could call my own. My old phone was fine, but I wanted something with ""quality"" and ""style"". I had looked at this phone many times, and saw the extreme price of around $700. I told myself I would never spend that kind of money on a phone like this.And then the phone went on sale for around $470. So I bought it, and here is my review.I've had this phone for around a month now and I am extremely pleased with my purchase. This phone is worth almost every single penny that I had spent on it.EXTERIOR :This phone is the most attractive phone I have ever seen. The screen-to-body ratio is sensational, and makes the phone extremely attractive from the front. And then you turn it to the side and get the aluminum casing that covers the entire phone except for the front. On the right side of the phone houses the trays, one for a micro-SIM and one for an SD card. You can't take off the back, which is a tad irritating, and you also can't remove the battery. In the instructions that come with the phone, they say if you have any problems or need to remove the battery, to find a Huawei location or send the phone in and have them do it. Honestly, that's extremely irritating, but I can see where they are coming from. This battery is probably massive, as it has a 4100 mAh. You could charge an iPhone from 0% to 100% with this battery, and still have 50% left on the Mate 7.HARDWARE :Since I already explained the battery, I guess we'll move onto the other spectacular aspects of the phone. This phone includes a processor that was created by Huawei to compete with Snappdragon. And they do a very good job, if I do say so myself. It comes with 8+1 cores, which is plenty for a phone like this. Gaming is a breeze with this phone, and even games like GTA San Andreas on Ultra graphics still runs smoothly. Compare that to the Note 4 which has about 10-15 FPS when playing GTA San Andreas on Ultra. The reason this is possible is because the Mate 7 ""only"" has a 1080p display, while the Note 4 has a 4k display. You can hardly tell, other than the fact that the screen on the Mate 7 is much softer than the Note 4, not having nearly as much ""sharpness"" as the Note 4 and other phones that include 4k displays like the LG G3. Anyway, 4 of the cores included with this phone are the primary ones, and they are the biggest ones that hold the most power. The other 4 are the secondary ones, which are used for internet browsing and other small tasks that don't need much power.The Mate 7 includes 2 microphones, one on the bottom and one on the top. This is used to remove background noise and overall create a ""good"" recording environment. The headphone jack is on the top of the phone next to the top microphone. Neither of them are centered, which is bothering to me. Even more bothering is the Micro-USB port on the bottom of the phone, which is slightly positioned to the left. The power button is located right below the volume keys. On the front of the phone is the calling speaker, the 5 MegaPixel front facing camera, the proximity and daylight sensor, and the notification light. The notification light has a red and green light that mixes together to create other colors, which is strange because there is no blue light (At least not that I have seen). There are no navigation buttons on the bottom of the phone, as they are located on screen when the phone is turned on. This allows for a massive screen to be on a phone the same size as the iPhone 6 Plus. The screen-to-body-ratio is 84% (I believe), which is insane. The screen fits nicely on the phone, and if you have the black model you can hardly tell the screen is even on there until you turn it on.SOFTWARE :The main problem I have with the software (mainly the EMUI 3.0 that Huawei includes with this phone) is that there is no app tray. This means that you have to have all apps on your home pages. You can create folders to organize everything, which is fine. Other than that, the EMUI is absolutely stunning. It's clean, modern, and absolutely beautiful. It's completely customizable, allowing you to apply other themes and whatnot. There's 6 themes that come with the phone, and if you want more, you'll have to find the Huawei theme store online. This phone isn't really included with much ""bloatware"", which is wonderful. It comes with all of the basic google applications and ""top apps"" which includes Polaris Office and Twitter. This phone also comes with a Magnifier app, which sets the 13 MegaPixel back camera into macro. This works extremely well, and looks absolutely wonderful.The browser that comes with this phone is slow and annoying. I would highly recommend using Google Chrome instead. The lock screen and the launcher is wonderful and I don't have any need to download others.FINGERPRINT SCANNER :This is one of the most accurate pieces of technology on this phone. I have literally had no problem with this fingerprint scanner. It's extremely easy to set a fingerprint up, and once you do, it works fantastic. You can unlock the phone without even turning the phone on; just place your finger on the scanner and it will unlock within a second. It's faster than any of the other unlock mechanisms that are included. This feature works so well, better than the Note 4 and all of the iPhones. Huawei said in their introduction video that they had teamed up with a Swedish company to create this scanner, and it works absolutely wonderfully.CAMERA :The front facing camera is perfect for ""selfies"". But that's really about it. The rear camera is wonderful for everything else. Videos are smooth and pictures are sharp. It almost works in the nighttime, but it's a little ""noisey"". Other than that, the camera is wonderful. Details are clear and sharp, and the macro aspect works wonderfully. This camera can be compared with the Note 4 camera easily in quality.MUSIC PLAYBACK :I thought I should include this because of the speaker on this phone. I absolutely love the speaker on this phone. It's so crisp and clear, and you can hear everything. It gets a bit muffled when there's a lot of background noise, but it's plenty loud when there's no background noise. Even when the speaker is quiet, it still ""rumbles"" the phone, and you can feel it all throughout the phone. The headphone jack sounds okay, nothing great. Bluetooth connection is almost instantaneous and rarely disconnects.CONCLUSION :And finally, we are going to conclude. Overall, this phone is absolutely wonderful. I am in love! If you want a phone that will fulfill all of your expectations and then some, and if you have the money for this phone, I would HIGHLY recommend buying it. You will not be disappointed in the performance of this phone. This phone is in competition with some of the best phones on the market, such as the Note 4. If you're looking for style, quality, and a great price, this phone is for you.",6.0

Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,4,"I've been using the Samsung r355c n10 phone for a little over 2 weeks and so far so great. Granted, it's not top quality but considering that it only costs $9.99, this phone is certainly worth the purchase, that is if you're looking for basic phone use (i.e. making phone calls, texting, as well as using the calendar, calculator, alarm etc.). However, if you want a phone that includes a fast internet connection, a camera that takes quality pictures, or video recording ability, you should look elsewhere. As for me, I'm happy with this phone so far and I'm also happy with Amazon. As usual Amazon delivered on time and the merchandise was in perfect condition. Thanks, Amazon :-DHere is what I've experienced & observed so far:BATTERY POWER: I tested the phone out a lot during the first few days. In other words, heavy usage. It took a little over 2 days before I had to recharge the battery. Then when I hardly used the phone (just a few short calls and several texting), the battery lasted for 5-6 days before I had to recharge. As of now, I'm happy with the battery. I just hope it'll stay this strong for a while.CALL RECEPTION: Solid reception. I can hear the person on the other end clearly and vice versa. With regard to dropped calls, I have not had one yet.CAMERA: Pictures aren't the best quality but they come out good enough. Unfortunately, there's no zoom which is a huge bummer for me since I'm a frequent user of the zoom feature. However, there are other features which make taking pictures fun, such as the series shot; mosaic shot; and my favorite, fun frames. For me that makes up a little for the quality of the pics.INTERNET ACCESS: This feature is ok for occasional use. However if you're looking for a phone mostly for internet browsing (if you internet daily for hours), you may want to look around and see what other choices are out there. As for this Samsung r355c phone, it's 10 cents a minute to internet; and be aware that the first minute will be deducted as soon as you press the browser key. The downloading of website pages is a bit slow to complete. I could not browse or navigate through any site until the downloading completely finished. I got 2 minutes deducted, once, for just visiting one page w/o hardly reading anything. If you do get this phone, this feature is not too bad if you have the time to wait for pages to download.KEYPAD:1). The key buttons are really small which worried me a bit because my fingers are medium sized and I keep my nails really short so I thought I'd have problems (i.e. pressing 2 keys at once or pressing the wrong keys). Surprisingly I've had no trouble typing. It's pretty easy.2). When not using the phone, it's best to lock the keypad down by holding down the space key for a few seconds. When the keypad is unlocked, it's easy to accidentally hit the browser key unknowingly and be charged for every minute the browser is on.3). Fyi the red ""End pwr"" key is the ""home"" key. I didn't know that until I read the instruction booklet a few days later. I kept pressing the ""back"" key a few times to get out of features like the camera mode, text messages, calendar, etc. just to get back to the home screen. Doh!SPEAKER: The clarity is excellent. MUCH clearer than my 2 laptops' speakers that's for sure.TEXT MSG: It was nice to find out it only costs 2 &1/2 cents (0.25 minutes) per text compared to the 10 cents (1.00 minute) I used to pay prior to switching to this phone. I also like that there's a character count which lets you know when you're about to hit the maximum (160 character per text). The one thing missing is the copy/cut/paste features. But it's a minor issue considering the price of this phone.TEXT PICTURE MSG: It cost 35 cents (3.50 minutes) to send & to receive a picture text message. I was a little bummed about that but oh well, it's still good.VIDEO RECORDER: there is none :-(I know I'm leaving out info about other features this phone offers, but hopefully what I already have written down will help some people decide whether or not this phone will suit their needs.",4.0

The phone has had multiple resets and still refuses to text some numbers. Everything else works fine on the phone and can be used as a phone but not to text some of my contacts. I have been unable to determine if it is a phone problem or cell service problem. Looks as though it may be a service problem.",0.0

"Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679",Samsung,119.99,3,"I purchased this because I wanted a decent smartphone without the exorbitant prices for monthly service for contract phones. That's exactly what I got. I don't talk much on the phone, and since I'm ancient, don't text:-) I really only have three complaints about this phone, which is otherwise worth every penny.The 1st complaint is that it has the older Android 2.3 OS. I have tablets with 4.0 and 4.1 and had a 3.2 before it was upgraded. There is NO comparison between these more advanced OS's and the one on this phone. I don't really mind it, but it's not nearly as useable.The 2nd complaint is the enormous amount of non-removable (without rooting) bloatware. A few of those apps are OK, but, serioiusly T-Mobile and Samsung, that's the most bloat junk I've ever seen, and I have a LOT of devices (addicted).The 3rd and most important negative is that the volume control is directly opposite the on/off button--side to side--so it's easy to turn your volume waaaay down or completely off while turning the phone on OR off. This bit me hard one day when I never heard a medical emergency phone call from my wife. This last problem is critical, but can be worked around by just paying attention to the problem.I'm not sorry I bought this phone. It is my first smartphone and without paying a lot for the phone or being tied into a contract, I now understand why folks are so crazy about them. The contract I chose is month to month and gives me all the calling and texting I'll ever need, as well as 5GB of data, which is fantastic for the price.Will I keep it? Heck, no. As soon as the new phone tsunami comes this fall and before Christmas, I will be buying the best one I can find. My wife will love this phone:-)The buying experience from Amazon was excellent, as usual...and no, I don't work for them.",3.0

Moto Z with Hasselblad True Zoom Moto Mod,,749.98,5,"After a day using the phone, I am very pleased. Battery life is good for a day of heavy use. Screen is AMAZINGLY crisp and bright. Camera is good. Call quality, as reported by folks I was talking to, is also very good/excellent. I like the Moto actions (chop-chop to turn on flashlight, twist-twist to activate camera, even when screen is locked), but I am not a fan of the Google Now launcher, so I installed the Arrow launcher, and that is a big improvement.I wish the phone had heartbeat sensor like my Note 4 did, and I do miss the multiple apps on the screen that the Note had, but the thin, light nature of this phone certainly makes up for it. Gaming performance is flawless for everything I have tried so far. I will likely end up replacing the stock camera app as it's pretty basic. But that's the advantage of almost pure stock Android, I get to choose what I want, and I don't have a bunch of junk I don't use hanging around unable to be removed.The magnet holding the backplate on is very secure, but I have not had any issues removing it. The phone also came with a plastic bumper to protect the edges, but with that on, you can't access the SIM/SD card tray. (Phone uses nano-SIM, so I had to get a new one as the Note 4 uses a larger card) I don't expect to need to go into that often once I get a new SD card, so that's not a big problem, but it's a bit annoying. Another ergonomic thing I have to get used to is the placement of the side buttons for power and volume. On my Note 4 the power button was on one side and the volume buttons on the other, but on the Moto Z they are all on the same side, with the power BELOW the volume buttons, which seems counter-intuitive. The lack of the S-Pen won't affect me much, as I rarely ended up using that as it was. Same goes for the headphone jack. I haven't used a wired headset in over a year. The Moto Z does come with a small adapter cable to allow you to convert the USB 3.1c port to a 1/8"" RCA jack, if you need one.Data speeds are as expected, using AT&T's LTE. WiFi uses both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, Bluetooth and NFC both work well, as evidenced by the connection initiated during initial configuration. I used the Google setup tool to copy settings from my Note 4 and all it took was a bump of the two devices.I haven't used the figerprint reader, but others I know with the same model say it works great.",3.0

BLU Life One X - 4G LTE Smartphone - GSM Unlocked - White,BLU,78.39,2,"I wanted to like this phone. I bought it as a backup phone for my HTC One M9 (which was having it's own set of problems) in mid-August. However, because of the issues with my main phone, I started using the BLU Life One X, and it held up reasonably well (even getting through the heavy usage required when I attend Comic Con in NYC). It had some minor issues with ghost touches, but nothing earth shattering. A couple weeks ago, it stopped being able to remain on if the batter fell below 40%, which again, was not a big deal, but it did start to get annoying. Then today, after minimal use, it shut down on its own when the battery got around 35% - so I put it on the charger, and let it be. However, it has not turned back on. Instead, it is stuck in a continuous loop between the battery charge screen and the boot screen while on the charger, and a black screen when I take it off. I've dealt with phones having issues with reboots, freezing, etc before, so I spent a good part of the day troubleshooting to no avail. I plan on keeping it off the charger, hopefully fully depleting the battery and seeing if that has any effect on it.I have e-mailed BLU Customer Service and hope they get back to me, but I've already moved on to a new phone (Moto G4), so it's not a top priority for me, given how inexpensive this phone was originally (bought it for $100). Most likely I will order another cheap back up phone, but it will most likely not be from BLU.",2.0

"Nokia C3-00 Unlocked Cell Phone (Slate) with QWERTY, Dedicated E-mail Key, 2 MP Camera, Media Player, WLAN, and MicroSD Slot",Nokia,49.99,5,"It's #1 feature in my opinion is battery life. I have left the phone on with bluetooth connectivity on and it has been 5 1/2 days on one charge with light phone and internet, I am down to one green bar on the battery but the thing still hasn't given me a low battery warning. Battery life is awesome.I use t-mobile and since I have wifi at home and work I don't need a data plan. I do have the $1.99 per MB of data service on my plan and if you have that then the phone will use tiny amounts of data to give you email alerts. After 5 days of being always on it has used 0.2 MB so I am looking at $2 or $4 a month for email alerts.The operating system is very primitive but the calendar (that syncs with outlook, but a USB cable is required, no wifi sync) and email (I use multiple accounts with gmail no problem) are both good. I got an 8 gb memory card so I could use it as an mp3 player. The thing in the middle looks like a track pad in the picture but it's just an up/down/left/right switch. There is no gps and really no useful apps to download for it. It does let you check facebook alerts easily if you are in to that but I used the space to always display the current date.If you want a phone with incredibly awesome battery life that lets you check your email, carry your schedule, and doesn't lock you in to an expensive plan for two years then this is the phone to get.",9.0

I tried 3 times on ebay, doing my homework on the sellers, but they were all flawed in some way (screen burn-in, screen color partially tinted, GPS not working, etc.). This was my second attempt on Amazon. The first one was obviously a refurb and the fit and finish was off. No way that thing was going to be water resistant. I looked into seller ratings and wanted a ""new"" S5. So far everyone indicated they were new, but they were clearly not. They didnt even have the decency to sell a product that could fool someone to think it was new. This time, I went with TopShelf Direct as my seller and this one is actually new, or darn well close enough to fool me and is functional and clean. No doubt, use these guys if you can.",1.0

Nokia N9 16GB 3G Wifi GPS NFC GSM Unlocked MeeGo Touchscreen (Black),Nokia,,4,"I got this phone on 18th January 2012. It looked amazing right out of the box and it has been a great experience owning this phone so far. That is not to say there are no niggling issues with this phone. However, I am willing to overlook those minor irritants for the sake of a great unlocked pentaband 3g phone. I used to have iphone 3g back in the day and then went to galaxy s2 last september. After doing the ritualistic rooting and unlocking, I gave the galaxy s2 to my wife and was using a spare nokia 5230 until now. And then I moved on to n9.I would say the move from Galaxy s2 to N9 was not really troublesome. I do miss the sheer speed of the galaxy s2. However after I got used to the speed of N9, the experience has been great. I am a great fan of simplistic designs and N9 with 3 home screens with no buttons and Swipe gestures fits right in. It is fun to know that the swipe is not just for the 3 home screens but it also drills down to apps like email, music, gallery, etc.For the techies who used to make modifications with android, you would feel right at home with N9 as well. It is very open and within no time you could install the developer tools and get going with your unix/linux skills.On the downside, I don't get 4g speeds like 5 mb down. However I don't feel it is too slow either with average download speeds of 2 mb. I am able to download huge files, tether with wifi hotspot feature and the phone doesn't get hot and slow down. The multi tasking functionality is really good. But I do hope the data speed and the momentary UI lag could be improved.Here are some of the apps to get started and having fun.1) N9 Tweak - ([...])2) Firefox fennec ([...])3) Air UI4) Netview5) Sketchit!Here is a quick summary.Pros:1) Unlocked2) Pentaband 3G - you could get 3G with AT&T, T-Mobile and so many other GSM providers3) Swipe UI4) The apps are less, but they are good.5) Easy to customize with open shell accessCons:1) The Slower while comparing to flagship products from competitors like samsung, apple, etc.2) Single core3) Probably the last meego device4) The speed only supports 3G and not 4G or LTE5) Relatively higher price of $500-$600 for the 16gb phone",8.0

HTC 8X 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Dual-Core Windows 8 Smartphone - Lime Yellow - AT&T - No Warranty,HTC,54.99,1,"I bought my HTC 8x new from a retail seller on Amazon. It was new and unopened. However, after 4 months, the three buttons on the bottom stopped functioning. I have never dropped it and always take great care of it. I thought HTC has good quality, but this happened within 4 months! So I sent it back to HTC and provided all receipts to proof that I only had this for 4 months, HTC still wants to charge me since HTC does not cover phones not purchased from Amazon. Be aware of it! It may stop function in a short time, and if you are going to buy it from any other sellers , check with them first to see if your phone is covered with warrantee.",8.0

BLU Q170T Samba TV Unlocked Dual SIM Quad-Band GSM Phone (Black/Red),BLU,19.78,5,"For an 11 year kid, this is an awesome phone. I originally gave my son a cheap Windows Lumia 635, which is a great little phone but it had way too many features, including full internet access via browser, full access to YouTube and things that I did not want my son to have access to yet. So this phone is great if you want your son or daughter to have a phone for emergencies and to be able to stay in touch with you, but you don't want them to have unfettered access to the internet yet. I'm really surprised by the breadth of features it has, like FM radio, TV, MP3/MP4 player, video/sound recorder, some basic internet apps like Facebook\Twitter\Skype (I don't intend to enable them) and Bluetooth for a $20 phone.So in summary, this is a steal for a $20 unlocked phone.

They will contact me within that period to pay $185 for the repair in case the damage is not warrantied.I called Sony on 8/6/13 and I was told that my phone will be shipped back the following day and they will email me the tracking#.I called them again the next day and they confirmed the same information.I called them on 8/8/13 requesting any updates.To my surprise, they escalated my case to a manager called Eddie.He affirmed they will contact me within 48 business hours.Unfortunately I never got a call back.On 08/12 I called them again.I spoke with another manager who did not bother wasting his time with me informing me that Eddie has left for the day and I have to call back the following day.Tuesday, I called and spoke with Eddie.He said that there is no part for my phone that is why it is on hold.He promised me to check if they can replace the phone.Eddie called me the following day stating that Sony will replace my phone and if I do mind if the color is black.This is the only color they have in stock.I did not mind.So Eddie confirmed that they will ship the new phone out that day and I will be receiving my phone the following day.AS I did not receive anything on 8/15, I called Eddie back to ask for a tracking number. He told me that he will get back to me by the end of the day with a tracking#.I was so surprised when I received a call from Sony, speaking with a supervisor Carlos who told me that my phone was evaluated and it is not a warranty issue.They won't repair it and they will send it back",36.0

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,129.0,5,"I've had this phone for a week and must say it lives up to the hype. A great midrange phone for budget price. $250 is a steal and I envy you who got the $199 deal.If you know this phone exists then you've most likely already seen reviews, you already know the good. You're here because you want to know what's bad right?ConsButton Placement - Its like this phone is made for lefties, I don't know what Alcatel was thinking when they inserted the power button WAYYY to the top left. You'll try to substitute with double tap to wake but it only works .75 of the time and you'll find it better to simply click the power button. The up/down volume buttons is something it will take a LONG TIME getting use to. I'm so used to the volume buttons being on the mid-left instead of top right... What were they thinking!? LolConnection - When I first got the phone it seemed to drop connection a bit, I'd say 1/5 calls. I was kinda pissed at first BUT the past 3 days it hasn't dropped any and I make lots of phone calls since I'm a supervisor and have a lot of unreliable employees. Also I live in Miami not like in the middle of no where so I have good reception.Camera - If you're coming from a high end device this rear facing camera won't impress you. Coming from a 8MP Galaxy S3 I'd say this camera JUST gets the job done. This camera is pretty bad at catching light if you take a picture at 12PM it looks like it was taken 6PM. Take it at 7PM it looks like it was taken 11PM. If you post 10 pictures on IG & FB everyday you'll probably want to aim for something with a better camera.Not trying to poop on the camera because like I said it gets the job done.In contrast the 8MP front facing camera is great. One of the few phones on the market with something above a 5MP front facing camera.Those are the only small negatives I can think of BUT its not really deal breaking which is why I still gave it 5 stars. If you're on the fence just click purchase you won't regret it. If so simply return it within 30 days. 😄",8.0

Apple iPhone SE Unlocked Phone -16 GB Retail Packaging - Rose Gold,Apple,420.9,5,This is my first time owning an iPhone & I must say that I'm thoroughly impressed so far. I am in Jamaica so I ordered it unlocked but was a bit skeptical as to whether it could really work in my country. It did! I'm so happy!! The packaging was beautiful! It's my second time buying a phone on Amazon & I've never been disappointed. I'm switching from a Samsung s4 mini which I bought on Amazon few years ago & I must say that was a great phone too. It fell so many times but still worked beautifully. I'm hoping that this new phone can withstand the falls just as well...I've digressed but that's my tidbit...,6.0

Samsung Galaxy S7 32 GB Unlocked Phone - G930FD Dual SIM - Pink Gold,Samsung,531.5,2,"While I am generally happy with the phone overall, I did encounter a MAJOR PROBLEM with Samsung, this phone, and buying international phones in the domestic USA. The sim tray on the Galaxy S7 is incredibly cheap plastic. It broke in half - with part of the tray stuck INSIDE the SIM assembly on the phone.The Amazon ad clearly designates that there is no warranty. That's helpful to know. However, when I contacted Samsung asking for help (i.e. - LET ME PAY YOU TO FIX MY PHONE) I was told that because this was an international phone, the domestic Samsung people will not help me.So I'm left right now with a device that I cannot use (that I purchased 3 months ago) because I cannot remove the plastic component that broke inside the phone. This would typically be covered by warranty, but there is no warranty on this device. I cannot pay to get it fixed by the manufacturer because they won't touch it.So because of poor support and lack of recourse I really would not recommend anyone go the route of purchasing an international variant Samsung device in the US.",25.0

I like its sensitivity - if you don't, you can change it in the General Settings of the phone.I would probably recommend this phone for people who are new to the BlackBerry world - it's a good way to get used to the BlackBerry interface, and develop skills on the platform before getting to the A++ BlackBerry phones (read: Bold and Bold 2, as well as the Storm 2).",10.0

The edges are finished with a shiny look with the appearance of stainless steel, adding to the well-defined look of this phone. The power button and volume control are both on the right side, leaving the left edge smooth. Dual speakers and a microphone embellish the bottom edge of the phone, giving it an iPhone-like look. The camera extends slightly from the back of the phone.Features: Not only is it internationally unlocked, but this phone includes a Dual SIM card slot, letting you easily share two phone plans in one device. It hosts a 5.5"" HD screen with a resolution of 960x540 (which is actually surprisingly crisp), and comes with 512 RAM and 8GB memory, It's got a Quad Core 1.3GHz processor, letting you run all your favorite apps and games. Android 5.1 comes pre-installed on this phone, so it literally worked straight out of the box. The company states that both cameras are 2MP, but honestly I think the selfie camera is better than that. Both can capture really solid photos to share with your friends. The Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n and GPS are fast and responsive, and the Bluetooth 2.0 was smooth and uninterrupted. The phone has it's own custom skin which was really nice and has a number of features you don't always find on stock skins, like a flashlight in the dropdown menu.Accessories: Included in the stylish packaging was a micro USB, headphones, a charger, and a clear case perfect for this phone. Also, the phone came with a screen protector already installed on its' screen, which is amazing for those who hate spending an hour trying to perfectly apply the screen protector!Note that this phone only supports phone plans on 3G (WCDMA 850/2100) and 2G Quad Band (GSM 850/900/1800/1900) networks, so make sure your provider does that.All in all, Juning managed to cram a number of really solid features into this low-cost unlocked phone and is really giving off an inspirational message about the development in the smartphone market, and what can be achieved at this price point. I highly recommend this phone to someone who isn't looking to spend a lot of money on their smartphone but still cares about full functionality and impressive build and look.I received this product at a discounted price, in exchange for an honest review.",4.0

In the 30 days that followed, the phone began crashing. It had green/black screen that would flash a white line and then appear to be asleep. The phone would not wake from this screen. We did a hard reset(pressing home key & power key simultaneously) and then plugged into itunes to restore. Restoring worked a few times to wake the phone or to actually restore it. We contacted the Seller (Solar Tech LLC) and Amazon, so far we have only heard from Solar Tech who told us we were out of warranty & therefore out of luck. We then took the phone to the Apple store who told us that it could not be restored. They would gladly repair it for the out of warranty fee of $329 or we could trade in our $500 broken phone and pay $300+ to purchase another refurbished phone w/ a 90 day warranty. We left the store w/ our broken phone and then ordered an iphone 5 from a different seller on Amazon. We will wait for the 7 to come out and possibly replace the 6plus when the prices come down.

Huawei Mate 2 - Factory Unlocked (Black),Huawei,229.99,3,"I purchased the Mate 2 and received it on 06/26/2014. I love the device for the price of $299 but there were some things that I think should have been updated with this product being it is the face of Huawei in the US. First and most important it should have been updated to Kit Kat either out of the box or as an update once on Wi-Fi, this would have attracted more customers to the phone. Notification Reminder, when you receive a text or email they need to add an option to put a reminder. You get busy doing things and you would forget someone text you or you received an email so it would be nice to set a reminder like every 2 minutes. The phone does have a light indicator which blinks but they made it too small for a 6.1’ screen especially when you are outside and mine being a white color you cannot really tell in the sunlight areas. One other thing if your charging your phone the light will not blink if you get a text or email so that sucks, you have your phone on vibrate or mute you will not know you got a notification if it is charging because on vibrate it only vibrates once when you receive the notification. It has a feature that I like which is a pop up message, this is so you can do a quick reply to a text without stopping what you’re doing like surfing the web or watching a movie. The only issue with this feature is when you are texting back and forth and you’re on the text conversation you still get the pop up message, it would be nice if the phone determine when your already in the conversation it would not pop up I had an LG Optimus G Pro and It had this feature and it determined when I was in the text conversation. ONE MAJOR thing with this phone is the LCD screen, some customers out there are experiencing issues with when you tap the phone there is like flash in the background where you tapped, if you YouTube this phone you can see some videos which I posted one myself. I returned my Mate 2 because of this issue plus when I had a white background you can see a white spot in the LCD screen(it’s in my video). I will try another Mate 2 and see if it was just my phone and if not then Huawei needs to fix this ASAP, $299 is still allot of money for an average phone. Hope this Helps",4.0

Not so on this phone because the screen is bright already. The battery lasts really well and she's on it constantly playing games and such. This was a great investment and I think she'll be sticking Motorola for a while instead of going back to any of the Samsung flagship phones.",3.0

Everything works well.However, after having used it for some months, then trying out an HTC m7 with a 4.7 inch screen, I wish I had gone with the 4.8inch version of the Alcatel oneTouch Idol. While readability and viewing videos from a distance is nice, the 5.5"" screen is too clumsy, too difficult to hold in one hand, and too long to fit in a pocket. It just scares me. I live in fear that it will grow too big for me to safely control anymore, and one day it will take over my life.It is also incredibly slippery without a case. More points off for handle-ability. I think they grease the backside with Crisco.

The item arrived and immediately there was a problem it was not 3g as advertised. I called tmobile gave them the name and serial # of phone and they informed me it was a candian phone not capable of 3g and would not work. I contacted the seller and they agreed to send me another phone. When that one arrived it worked for about a week. I then started having problems with it working on 3g again. It would come and go. I again took the phone into tmobile only to be told again it was not really 3g capable and would eventually stop working on that network all together. I then contacted the seller once more. This time the customer service rep was not so nice. He basically told me I was just trying to get a free phone. I assure you I have no problem paying for a phone but I want what I pay for. He then said I could send back the phone and once received they would issue me a credit. He was not willing to pay for the retuen shipping as if this is my fault and I should pay? He also said I had to have the original box. It had been over a month and I no longer had the box. This has to be one of the worst companys to buy from. I urge everyone to shop elsewhere.

Hype follows this phone for odd reasons though. This phone's screen is by far the worst thing, with on screen burn-ins from the always present on-screen hotkeys and nav bar on top. It's okay for everyday apps like Facebook, but take a grain of salt that you are destroying your phones screen. The phone overheats after 15 mins of use, too the point where I would have to set my phone somewhere cool to prevent further damage. Charging it from the original box it arrived with charges it at a decent price, if you don't mind burning your hand checking your phone. Other then the burn in on the screen and the overheating, signal drops several times a day, most likely from the overheating while trying to charge my device.

"Nokia C6 Unlocked GSM Phone with Easy E-mail Setup, Side-Sliding Touchscreen, QWERTY, 5 MP Camera, and Free Ovi Maps Navigation (Black)",Nokia,59.95,4,"I'm simply loving this phone. The only drawback I have, and the reason I did not give it a 5 star rating, is that yes, the OS is a bit laggy when opening screens and you get the white screen for a second or two and I had some apps close on me without any apparent reason or any error message (specially true with the Opera Mobile app).However, the Interent connection is a breeze (but will depend on your internet plan), and using Sports Tracker with the GPS capability is great and very precise. Be aware that the first time you run your GPS on the phone (and anytime you do a hard reset) you NEED to be outside with a clear view of the sky or you will not get a lock. Once you have established the first lock on the sattelites, subsequent locks are a cinch.The phone's constructions is very sturdy, the resistive touch screen is quick to respond and very intuitive to use, even when wearing my motorcycle gloves. So I have no problem with having a resistive touch screen.And for that added benefit, the price of the phone has already dropped $15 since I purchased it, so you can get a good quality phone for one great price.",3.0

No more $300-500 phones for me. This one has superb battery life! This one is rated as 400mAh, the S6 was about 2600mAh which even with the quick charge had to be charged at least twice a day. This blu phone does not need fast charging! I have been using the GPS and Pandora all day while I drive on the road for work. I get home by 6pm. Phone shows 35%. I shut off the location and use my home WiFi. By 11pm, when I am ready to go to bed its still at 20% !! Processor is pretty quick, screen is nice and bright even in the sunny Florida weather. Goggle Chromecast does NOT work, must be a glich in programming as I see it is an issue on web forums. Camera is decent, not like my old Samsung S6, but clear enough. No LED to let u know phone is charging or to let u know if u have missed a call or gotten a text. Looking fot a phone case is the biggest pain. I have been searching, no one makes a nice heavy duty one like an otter box. It has very little bloatware, takes up about 3.5G. My old Samsung S6 was doubled at 7G with all the crap AT&T bloatware they put on it. Its not an LTE phone , but fast enough for me. All in all, I am pretty happy with it.",2.0

"Apple iPhone 5 Cellphone, 16GB, Black (AT&T)",Apple,139.95,4,"This refurbished iPhone 5 works just fine, but the refurbishment was clearly done using a cheaper than OEM replacement screen. We have three phones in the house and although this one works just fine the screen is a little duller in color than the other two.I've replaced screens before and you can buy high and low quality screens. Probably come off the same line, but some don't pass the full quality tests. This refurb phone has a slightly yellowish tint to the screen compared to the other phones. It works just fine so still gets 4 stars, and the price was good, but the slight dimming of the screen drops a star.In the end it still beats paying over $500 for a new phone!",0.0

Motorola Moto G LTE- Factory Unlocked US Warranty (Black),,108.0,1,"Not only are Motorola phones notoriously defective, their technical and customer support is the most frustrating experience. I have had three defective phones. For each phone, I was jerked around for several months, filled with promises of refund/replacement. I pre-paid for one replacement phone in order to speed up the process but Motorola did not send me anything but lies such as they did not have my correct address. I requested them to credit back my credit card for the pre-payment since now the processing speed was long overdue, but was told that the refund check would take weeks to process. Refunds are notoriously difficult to obtain, even though the case was escalated to the ""white glove"" department. I was continually reassured by each customer service representative that THIS time, my case would be handled correctly. And each time, after several weeks' delay, I would call back only to find that the case was NOT handled correctly by the last agent but again assured that THIS time it would be. Again, these statements were merely stall tactics to avoid refunding the purchase price after the replacement phone also proved defective.Getting a working Motorola phone is a roulette chance. Once you experience problems and attempt to use Motorola's customer support, you find that their internal system is as defective as their phones. I urge new customers to avoid Motorola and save themselves weeks of aggravation.",0.0

There is no transition time between multitasking, and apps open immediately.The fingerprint sensor placement is perfect, and able to have many different prints saved, making it convenient for varying grip styles.The only negatives are;1) The battery life: you would probably have trouble keeping a charge for more than a day with average use. If you watch YouTube videos for more than 4 hours or so, it will reach 0%.2) Heat: using the device while plugged in, or doing intensive tasks will generate a fair amount of heat.

The silicon case it comes with was all clear (better than the s500a, which is translucent on the back). The screen protector is great (the s500a was sort of papery feeling). The X510a seems a tad quicker than the s500a and it has been a great phone for my wife.

I came to this from a full-fledged smartphone and didn't feel like I was missing much; I still got to use my major smartphone apps like Google Maps, Whatsapp, Facebook, and Gmail.The build quality is excellent; I've had many people mistake it for a Blackberry or similar. It *looks* much more expensive than it is. And since it's a relatively inexpensive purchase, you don't need to coddle it as you would, say, an iPhone or high-end Android device. What's more, it's rugged. I drop my electronics on a daily basis, and the C3 is none the worse for wear after about a month of use.Battery life is good. I can unplug the phone Monday morning and not have to charge it again until Wednesday night, and that's with heavy use. It should get you through a weekend without charging no problem.The camera is a paltry 2 megapixel affair, but it is capable of some surprisingly nice-looking shots. More than adequate for posting to Facebook or similar.I use the phone with a T-Mobile SIM, and I get as good a signal as I have with any device save the (much more expensive) Nokia N8.Pairing this with a prepaid plan is a great way to get a very capable device for very little coin.",8.0

I received a no brand generic Chinese charger that it is not able to remain attached to the cell phone during charging because of the weakness of its attachment clips at the micro usb connector.

Moreover, I think that the back shell is not original because it arrived with a little dent in one of its corners and with no brand (Nokia/AT&T) or parte number it is completely flat (inside and outside) and is so weak that I damaged a corner with the nail trying to remove the shell to install the battery. I was able to update the OS to WP Amber and it works really fast.As you can see on previous reviews Nokia L820 is a really good cell phone (a little giant but not excellent) with fluent WP8 but with really two big sins: the 1650mAh Battery is too little for all things that you can do with this cell phone and the lacking of gorilla glass.",2.0

I really wanted the Nexus product since I will get the security updates for Android that all of the other carriers seem to avoid deploying so they can make more money on the upgrade cycle. There is one suggestion I would make ... it comes with an international power adapter, a USB-C to USB-C cable, and a kludgy converter to plug in to US sockets. I think it would be better to just give people the USB-C to USB-C cable and then a USB-C to USB-A adapter.

In less than a month black lines started forming on the right side of the screen for no reason. Never dropped the phone or etc. A few weeks later the windows button that returns you home stopped. About a week after that it would freeze on a black screen, and if you received a call or text while on the black screen you could not answer it. My alarm went off and it would not even stop until I held the power button long enough to turn off the stupid thing. This started happening once maybe twice a day and within a few days it was happening every hour. I contacted LG whom amazon told us to contact for the warranty and it was a pain to talk to them. Still have the phone and no one seems to want to help. I have had the darn thing for just about 2 months now. I would not recommend this phone to anyone.

Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (White),Sony,248.98,5,"This is perhaps the best phone I've yet had when you consider it's feature-set and design both independently and compared to it's contemporary peers.Between the small bezel and frame housing a 5"" screen, the extensive LTE support and usual high-end specs -- 1.5GHz snapdragon, 2GB memory, 12MPixel camera, 2370mAh battery -- it's an impressive piece of hardware. The industrial design is just sexy, in my opinion. I do wish it had the waterproofing of the Z or ZR, but this is a worthy trade-off in my mind for it's smaller size, especially considering my usage.I've heard a few complaints that it shipped with the Snapdragon APQ8064 processor clocked @ 1.5 and while I'll take any processor improvement I can get (Snapdragon 800 would be great), so far the UI is smooth and 1080p x264/AVC videos run well. Frankly, these phones summed over a normal usage pattern spend most of their times down-clocked, so the extra head room is only seen in edge-cases. And in the long-term, as Android advances it seems to be most sensitive to memory capacity, which all these phones have 2GB of.So, I very much like this phone. In hardware terms it's fantastic. I have no complaints and as long as Sony keeps up the quick work in porting over new Android revisions, I'll be happy.",1.0

It's my first ever and so far I'm having a lot of fun with it. It comes w/ several pre loaded apps such as Twitter, Facebook & Youtube and two games, one being Angry Birds. It's pretty easy to use and it is unlocked so you can use it with any Sim card. I used my T-Mobile one just to see if it would work and it did while having an extra slot for another Sim card. It also uses Wi-Fi (as well as 3G/2G) and you can watch videos on it/connect it to your computer to add photos/songs to it.The only complaint I have is the battery life seems to run down at a sort of, steady rate I suppose. You get I think 5hrs after charging and then it ticks down bit by bit. It's not too bad but if you're gonna be on the move and can't recharge for a while it's something you should keep an eye on. However you can charge it while using it but I suppose that's not too good for the battery. All in all though I really like it and so far it's doing exactly what I needed it to do.

"Motorola Droid 2 A955 Verizon Phone 5MP Cam, WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth",Motorola,82.0,5,"I bought this for my teenage daughter along with a 16gb sd card for $20.So for well under $100 she has a decent first smartphone.She uses it to read books on the Kindle app,she downloaded a mp3 type app and now downloads and listens to music via headphones(constantly:-))goes on facebook,take photos and videos,texts and calls of course and play a couple games she likes.So she's not a heavy user like her dad.This phone wont handle too many running widgets but it does play games good,run live wallpapers if you're into that and search the web okay.It has a 4 row qwerty (the top row has the numbers as well as the qwerty row) a removable battery (why manufacturers are making them these days without a keyboard or interchangeable batteries is beyond me) and a flash foe the camera and digital recorder.It's not a bad phone at all for the price just don't put too much strain on it,one task at a time and it works and looks good.For the price I definitely recommend it,just know that it doesn't come close to the phones coming out today as far as power.But the phones coming out today will be the same way in a couple years,they basically get 'old' in roughly 6 months so you have to watch what software you downloadIt does basically the same things as brand new phones just not as fast.Google Maps,no problem,Google searches also no problem.A decent phone especially for a first smartphone.I'm telling you,my daughter is very happy with it and that's what I wanted.I guess she can multi task with it with some things cause after she gets done with her homework more often than not she can be found with her headphones on listening to her music app while also reading from her Kindle app.I honestly don't know why there's so many negative reviews,I have a new and powerful smartphone and her Droid 2 will literally do almost everything mine does.The Droid 2 just can't run as many things at once as my phone but if they're done one at a time there's no problems.It can do basically everything and do it for a quarter the price.I haven't checked current prices but I bought my daughters Droid 2 a couple months ago via Amazon for $64.99 then got her a bigger sd card than mine also via Amazon for half what I paid for mine out of the store.So her Droid 2 can actually store a lot more info than my new phone can because she has a 16gb card and I have an 8gb.If you're new to these phones and not familiar with digital storage even 8gb is a lot.With an 8gb sd card combined with my phones internal memory I've downloaded over 250 apps not including what comes preinstalled,I've taken over 750 photos that are still stored in my phone,over an hour of video and lots of other stuff and I still have memory left.Also,if this is your first smartphone you'll probably be like most everybody else and get lots of cool apps,some of them cost money but once you buy them they're always yours even if you switch phones.Just sign up your new phone with the same email address and you can put all your paid apps on your new phone without paying again.I was so relieved when I found that out:-)I hope that helps,the Droid 2 is a really good phone for what they're asking here.I would recommend getting an extra charger for your car,they're like $3 here on Amazon,and also get a good protective cover.They make todays phone very fragile on purpose I imagine so we're forced to buy new ones in the event we drop them one too many times.My first cell phone I had back in the 90's was made like a brick,I could have literally dropped it off a roof and it would have been okay.You don't want to hop out of your car with your phone in your lap with today's phones,that's how I broke my last one:-)Droid 2 is a great starter smartphone in my opinion.",24.0

Cheap2. The phone is fast and scrolls extremely well3. 5mp with flash, pro with the cost but most phones in this range are around 8mp4. front facing camera5. Has a battery save option to extend the phones life6. Rubberized back to give grip without a case, but still recommended7. Access to google play, I've used TF and have had only basic phones with java games, a great leap forward for me8. has gravity sensor and will tilt/turn to better fit the way your holding.Cons1. unknown brand, no one will know how to pronounce Huawei2. Not much storage but a cheap 16gb is only $9Unsure about its ability to be dropped, if screen is gorilla glass, and can withstand a few flops or not.",2.0

"Nokia E63-2 Unlocked Phone with 2 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, Media Player, and MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (Ultramarine Blue)",Nokia,286.0,3,"I chose Nokia because I loved all the previous models I had owned (for the last 4 years, 6030). But I also wanted to get fee-free navigation and only Nokia offers downloadable maps. On the paper it seemed to have clear advantage over Google Maps, but for practical usability Nokia Maps are light-years behind Google's. Setting way-points is cumbersome, saving the directions list is not possible (at least i have not found it in 2 months) so once you view the directions and want to return to the map the route disappears, the location names (cities, road numbers etc) show up only at close zoom making visual navigation like one would do with a paper map rather cumbersome, searching for addresses and businesses usually does not find anything. In all, I have not been able to use the Nokia Maps in any practical navigation situation. It only works when you have plenty of time and can sit on a sofa and patiently jump through the hoops that Nokia has decided to lay on your path. Google Maps, on the other hand has been very intuitive, it shows more information at lower zoom levels and allows switching between text directions and map view without losing either.For all the other features and capabilities - like e-mail, calendar and contact sync, downloadable applications (Skype!), office capabilities (although not quite smooth yet) and all the other extras - I think E63 is more than worth its cost. It's a solid performer. But the maps, which was one of the main deciding points for me, it's a big flop.Another thing that disappoints me is that the sound quality for phone calls is poor. My 6030 was definitely a lower-end phone but its voice quality was much better than the E63's. Radio and music playback are fine, so I guess it has to do with cell signal processing. There may be all the bars for signal strength, but the sound is nearly always a bit crackly.",3.0

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,2,"From the start, it exhibited a number of big problems. First off, the wi-fi driver would screw up and wouldn't turn on, no matter how I turned it on. In Wi-fi settings it would simply read ""error."" There is a phone number you can type in to restart the driver and fix it, but it was happening so often that it was unacceptable.Second, calls. Even with full signal and all, for some reason, the phone simply wouldn't make calls. You would dial a number, and it would hang up before the call even began. I tried everything and to no avail.Third: the phone kept shutting itself off. Randomly, the screen would go black and I would have to turn it on again. It was aggravating and made the phone rather unusable.Overall I think that if these bugs were fixed, it would be a fine entry-to-mid-level Android phone. It looks nice, sounds nice, has all the bells and whistles- but until they work properly, then it is all moot. Returning.",4.0

Google Voice is not working in the intended manner with the most recent updates. Usually when a call is made it sends it from my Google Voice number and not from the number associated with the SIM card. This is accomplished by checking an option in the Google Voice app to ""make all calls through Google Voice"". This is not working with the most recent updates and all calls are made using the phone number associated with the sim card.Also, if you check the option to integrate Google Voice voicemail with the dialer, it works in that you can see the voicemails in the call history, but if you try and play one it crashes the Contacts app everytime",4.0

"Sony Xperia X unlocked smartphone,32GB Rose Gold (US Warranty)",Sony,399.99,5,"#First Impresion.My last phone was Samsung Galaxy Duos and I upgrade my phone to this one looking for a phonewith much faster performance and better build quality, since I mostly use my phone for communicating with people,taking pictures once in a while and watching random youtube videos.I bought the white version and so far I really love the build quality!The quick charger works pretty well. It took me around 1 hour to fully charge the Xperia X from 30% to 100%.(Since I came from a very old phone) The camera is great, the screen is gorgeous andthe phone size is just perfect for my hand.# 2 weeksAfter two weeks using this phone I just can say that I really enjoy using this phone.The battery life can sustain for 1.5 day if you don't use the phone often (just chatting, looking social media, browsing a little bit).But if you use it for gaming, it can only last for 3-4 hours. Since I only use this phone forcommunication, and some browsing, it's totally fit the purpose. And the quick charging feature also works fine.Again, camera is superb for me. And the dual front speaker is also great to listen.Also, I have never experienced any lagging so far.Last thing, I realized why the build quality of this phone is so beautiful when I tried to compare my phoneto my friend's iPhone 6s. And it turns out that their build quality are similar.The only difference is that this Sony phone is thicker, which is still acceptable for me.Some negatives that you might experience:- fingerprint sensor is installed, but you can not use it in US version - that's unfortunate,- i occasionally miss-type on the swift keyboard - somehow i feel it is too dense.But other than that it's just a great phone.Since the price of this phone is a little bit cheaper than a new iPhone SE 16GB,I will easily choose this phone over the iPhone SE.",

Netflix won't work. It won't let me update my iOS. Has Chinese lettering in the back, like wtf. So many problems with this.

Sony Xperia ZR C5502 Unlocked GSM IP58-Certified WaterProof Smartphone w/ 13MP Camera and Dust Resistant - White,Sony,129.95,4,"I got this for ~$250 new. I have to say, it is an excellent mid-ranger even though the phone is already a year old from launch. I don't know why this phone isn't more popular. It has specs comparable to the Moto X, but is cheaper and with more hardware features such as a micro-sd slot, removable battery, and has certified water-resistance. It even has a dedicated camera shutter button!Sure there are some that will receive a phone hardware defects, but those are usually made rather obvious within the seller's return period, and while some people have battery draining problems with 4.4.2 KitKat, it could be circumvented after looking in the xda forums.Now, there is something that I don't like. The flap on the headphones. They should have nano-coated jack since it is a hassle to open.Now, for some tips, you should definitely get a screen protector as soon as you receive it. The Anti-shatter film is easily scratched. Luckily, it does come with a matte screen protector aside from the anti-shatter film, but it is easily taken off.Getting a dock is also recommended since it would prevent the loosening of the flap on the micro-usb port.",2.0

"Conquest S8 Pro 3GB RAM Smartphone - 5 Inch IPS Screen, 4G, Android 5.1, Compass, SOS, NFC, OTG, Walkie-Talkie (Black)",Conquest S8 Pro 3GB Smartphone (Black),576.2,1,"NORTH AMERICAN BUYERS: BEWARE OF THE MISINFORMATION PRESENTED BY SELLERS OF THE S8 PRO.I have been to EVERY North American wireless carrier to set up service on this phone and this is what you will get (or not get);*Understand each wireless carrier in North America has different ""bands"" they provide cellular service on so I went to each NA carrier to try and get this phone to work on their network.VERIZON: You will be UNABLE to use Verizon with this phone. I originally had Verizon and we had 3 techs try and get their sim to work on the Verizon network to no avail. By ""techs working"" on the phones I mean going so far as going into the settings a manually programming the network specs into the phone to make sure everything was correct. No such luck.AT&T: My next stop was to AT&T. I went directly to their local tech support office so that I would be dealing with their most experienced people. We were able to get the AT&T sim card to access the network but ONLY at the slowest Edge network speeds. Again, thru AT&T you will only get their slowest ""Edge"" network speeds. We did a speed test on the phone by accessing [...]on which we only got a max speed of 250+/- kpbs. Dismal speeds virtually rendering the phone useless on AT&T's network.T-Mobile: Next stop was T-Mobile. We we're able to get a T-Mobile sim to access their network but only at a maximum of 3G speeds Again, T-mobile WAS able to access their network but only at a max of 3G. NO 4G LTE. While 3G is better than nothing you will notice apps such a Waze have a difficult time centering your location and Waze and other mapping programs seem to have some difficulty getting your positioning right. *I had my iPhone 6plus right next to the Conquest S8 Pro on Verizon's network and it was working perfectly with all the apps that the Conquest was having slow network issues with.Sprint: Went to sprint. Sprint does not support these phones and does not provide SIM's to access their network.Boost Mobile: Same story at Sprint...they only provide service for their phones.So, long story short, or, TLDR; the BEST/ FASTEST speed's you will be able to achieve with this phone in North America will be thru T-mobile at 3G speeds.PHONE PHYSICAL REVIEW;The phone itself relating to it's rugged capabilities is as advertised. It is very rugged looking and feeling. I have a home scanner and tried out the internal walkie talkie and it works good The android system works good and the touch screen is responsive, bright and works with a gloved hand. One of the best features is the speaker boost which increases the external speaker volume to very loud levels....perfectly easy to hear over loud machinery.So why the one star review? Simple, this is a Smart Phone. We need these to be able to interact with the cellular networks of our local countries systems at their current levels. With the best speeds of only 3G available you are starting out behind the curve and will only get further behind as they are already working on 5g.If you are a North American (United States) prospective purchaser I cannot recommend this phone for you. Hopefully my trials and tribulations with trying to get this to work on the US Network will help save you some headaches.",13.0

Apple iPhone 5s 16GB (Gold) - T-Mobile,Apple,279.99,2,"It ""looked"" new, as it was in a box packaged in cellophane, but on close inspection, it's clearly a refurbished phone. It had a few light nicks and scratches, nothing I was really worried about, but the camera totally sucked. No matter what trick I tried (I've read all the message boards), the camera on this phone simply will not focus. Overall, I don't recommend purchasing this item. Just go to an Apple store and get the iPhone S. Yes, it will cost you about $150 more, but it's well worth the extra money. I ended up doing that after having this phone for only 2 months. The camera feature is too important to me. Plus, if you purchase a new phone, you'll have the warranty and protection. Buying this particular phone from this particular company is very risky.",0.0

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,5,"I purchased this phone for a couple of months and to be honest is my first experience with smartphones, because it has taken me several days to get familiar with its operation, and I went from having a regular phone to this incredibly functional gadget and change has been a noticeable leap, its 800 mHz processor is quite fast and efficient. The touch screen is very good quality, sensible, scratch resistent (gorilla glass), decent amazing definition and brightness. It's camera takes pictures of acceptable quality, and the video runs smoothly. The size of the phone without being small makes it suitable for carrying in your pocket without a problem, or the discomfort of smartphones largest and highest range and price.Android as operattivo system is very friendly and intuitive, easy to use and I love power because all you can do with a phone and more!Works great with the 3G network from my country (Costa Rica). Simply insert the SIM and voila, a few minutes I was conected and running properly, I did not think it would be so simple to be honest!The only negative thing I could say so far is the short battery life when using multiple functions simultaneously (common problem with smartphones) as already mentioned in other grades here ... But this is easily solved with an extra charger in the office and at home, and upload daily ... jeje!At last I can recommend this phone without fear for those who like me (not being a fan for the latest in technology) nedd the benefits of a smartphone that have a good average performance, but with several extra applications that allow you to grow and evolve according to your needs as a user ... By the way I wrote this review from my phone, which I think is really amazing!Adquirí este telefono desde hace un par de meses y para ser sincero es mi primer experiencia con smartphones, debido a esto me ha tomado varios dias para familiarizarme con su funcionamiento, ya que pasé de tener un telefono regular a este increiblemente funcional aparatito y el cambio ha sido un salto cualitativo notorio, su procesador de 800 mhz es bastante rapido y eficiente. La pantalla tactil es de muy buena calidad, sensible, resistente a rayones (gorilla glass), con decente definicion y brillos asombrosos. Su camara toma fotos de una calidad aceptable, y el video corre muy bien. El tamaño del telefono sin ser pequeño, lo hace adecuado para llevarlo en el bolsillo sin mayor problema, ni la incomodidad de smartphones mas grandes y de mayor rango y precio.Android como sistema operattivo es muy amigable e intuitivo, facil de usar y me encanta ya que potencia todo lo que puedes hacer con un telefono y mas!Funciona muy bien con la red 3G de mi pais (Costa Rica). Simplemente insertar el SIM y listo, a los pocos minutos ya estaba enlazado y funcionando adecudamente, no crei que seria tan sencillo para ser honestos!La unica cosa negativa que podria decir hasta ahora es la corta duracion de la bateria al usar varias funciones simultaneamente (problema comun con los smartphones) como ya lo han mencionado en otras calificaciones aqui... Pero esto es facilmente solucionable con un cargador extra en la oficina y otro en casa, y cargarlo diariamente... jeje!En fin puedo recomendar sin temores a este telefono para aquellos que como yo (sin ser un fanatico por lo ultimo en tecnolgia) ocupamos los beneficios de un buen smartphone de desempeño medio, pero con varias aplicaciones extra que te permitan crecer segun tus necesidades y evolucionar como usuario... Por cierto he escrito esta critica desde mi telefono; lo cual me parece asombroso!!!",197.0

Apple iPhone 6 Plus 64GB Unlocked Smartphone - Silver (Certified Refurbished),,529.99,5,"Definitely my favorite iPhone so far! Apple hit a homer with this iPhone! First let me start off by saying this phone has the best battery I have ever had! Phones I've had: Samsung S6, iPhone 6, Nexus 6P, iPhone 5s, NONE of these can keep up with the battery on the iPhone 6 Plus. The camera is good although Samsung does make better cameras, you can always take a great picture with an iPhone. I recommend using google Photos app, there is a pop feature on there that makes your pictures look great. I also recommend the VSCO camera app for editing pictures.iOS runs fantastic on here and apps look beautiful on the larger display. I'd definitely recommend it over the regular 6. Althugh it is more expensive, once you get adjusted to the larger screen you definitely won't want to go back to a small screen. This is 2016, a 4.7 inch display on an iPhone is just too small. So if larger screen and better battery don't sell you, keep in mind the PLUS also has Optical Image Stabilization (OIS). This is an excellent feature which the iPhone 6 lacks and can be quite bothersome if you take pictures/videos of children or dogs because they tend to move and your pictures lose focus. I could not be happier with the iPhone 6 Plus.",0.0

Blu LIFE 8 Unlocked (Orange),BLU,169.99,3,"I bought this phone as an upgrade to my Dash4.5, that was beginning to slow down under the pressure of ever-demanding applications. I was hoping to upgrade from the Dash Antutu index of 7k to the impressive Life Antutu index of 26k. The specs of this phone were definitely an upgrade, but the phone itself was somewhat of a disappointment.The Positives - The screen is crisp and viewable from most angles. The processing power is pretty good, although the speed is not blazing, as the specs would indicate. The music player is very good, particularly if you use a high-quality headset instead of the speaker or the stock headset. The GPS is responsive, and the download speed is fast, although not blazing. The phone connects to TMobile 3G very comfortably The camera is quirky, but pretty good. It might take a while to learn all of the features of the phone, since the settings and instructions are not entirely clear. The battery lasts more than 24 hours with medium use. The phone is pleasantly thin and light. The included case is a nice touch.The Negatives – The extra strip at the bottom is very annoying, aesthetically and operationally. The screen rotation does not always work, and sometimes it is sluggish; although most of the time it is pretty quick. The phone drops the connection frequently – sometimes it drops the connection with a “SIM card not found” message. The BlueTooth feature either does not work or does not work properly, I am not sure which.",6.0

Two of the phones were fried because silly me tried to use a 16gb micro sd card (as recommended by LG) and tried to sync music while the sd card was in the phone (as recommended, because music files have to be converted to AT&T's specifications) .. After an error message, the phone shut off and all that is left is a blinking ""LG - Life's Good""..

I posted sreenshots from youtube and Netflix on here.Gaming on this phone is awesome, it looks great and runs smooth I've player several games but included sreenshots of Dead Effect and Vice city on amazon.The GPS is terrible on this device it just doesn't work really. constantly rerouting when your on a 10 lane hwy heading straight, it cannot located my actual location. If I'm sitting in my house it has me 3 streets down. I've never had smart phone with a GPS this bad really.The Camera is just not that great really. the flash is completely overbearing and will ruin every picture so you have to have it turned off completely and deal with lighting so basically this phone can only take ok pictures outside. The Video from this device is worthless, pixely and crappy even when set to FINE. One of the reason's I bought this phone was for the 13 mega pixel camera and its nice that you can put a high number next to the pixel rating but not really if it doesn't work worth a damn. So kind of deceptive advertising because a 4 or 8 mega pixel camera in a older device will out perform the camera in the L120.The Wifi on this phone is not very good, I can be standing next to my house's router and get about 4 of 5 bars, if I go to the garage which is directly under my router I get 1 bar, my laptop in my garage gets 5 so yeah not that great on wifi.NO KITCAT 4.4! they once touted 4.4 on Blu Phones coming in spring and then that changed to the middle of summer and then it went to oh forgot to tell you its only for about 6 models of the phones that we make. Blu has strayed away from support for this phone in favor of their ""Newer Models"" I don't see this phone ever getting KitCat or any updates fro Blu. Guess you could root it.The service I have at&t is good haven't really had problems with that which is the redeeming part of this phone because if it was having issues with service combined with all the other things I mentioned I would be looking for a new phone and partly I am anyways and this device just under performs in several key categories for me, that I depend on and use daily.I've also had dealings with blu costumer service as this is not my 1st blu phone and with out going into a whole lot of detail you will not be impressed lets put it that way. I know they tout the 1 year warranty ect. but what does it really cover?, not much if anything. And if you do break your phone and need repair I wish you all the luck in the world cause you are going to need it.So bring on the flames, I don't care this is my honest review after using this phone for a extended period of time not just 2 days. I can't just give 5 starts because something looks cool, when a lot of its everyday feature are questionable at best!Helpful info:To take a screen shot hold power and the volume buttons simultaneously.Here are the working APN NET10 Setting for this phone: Name=Net10, APN=tfdata, APN Type=default,mms,supl, Proxy=not set, Port=Not set, User Name=Not set, Password=Not set, Server=Not set, MMSC=[...], MMS proxy=mms2.tracphone.com, MMS port=80, MCC=310, MNC=410, Authentication type=Not set, APN protocol=lPv4, APN roaming protocol=lPv4, APN enable/disable=APN enabled, Bearer=UnspecifiedUPDATE: 10/3/14My phone no longer works properly, It reboots and goes into sleep and you can't get it to do anything unless you take the back cover off and unplug the battery. It happens 5 or 6 times a day now. I basically miss every call and can't really rely in this phone to well...be a phone. So it came with the so called 1 year warranty but apparently the warranty doesn't cover anything its a complete joke, more and more this phone is and was just a bad purchase. No its not just ok anymore its change to NO I DON'T LIKE THIS!!! I would say by the end of the year this will be down to 1 star I HATE THIS PHONE!UPDATE: 1/21/15I'm almost to the year mark and thank god the torture is almost over, I plan to replace this unit with a better quality phone from major manufacture at the end of this month, not to knock Blu but this phone didn't meet my expectations and fell short in ever category. In the end the data service on my phone will not work anymore the only thing that I can do is hook it up trough WiFi but this phone doesn't really have a great WiFi range either. The GPS has never really worked, didn't work with net10 and when we switched to AT&t same thing just doesn't work. The Mini SD card slot quit working a few months back so I don't have expandable data options anymore. The Flash on this device as noted by several users not just me, completely sucks and ruins every picture you take so you can never ever use it. The phone also has issues charging and resetting itself which has grown worse and worse. I will say this...over $200 dollars for a phone that couldn't really make it a year is not exceptable, Its not good for business, its not good for the environment, this is ridiculous. My parents had the same damn phone my entire childhood and here we are buying phones ever couple months..its not right this is damn disposable phone and this is a problem we are all going to own and have to own up to someday very soon!",4.0

I freaked out and requested an immediate return authorization because I could not use the phone and did not see where the memory card slot is. The start up guide said nothing about where the memory card slot is located. By the light of day and after a quick stop at the AT&T service center, they explained that the sim card used in this phone is ""micro"". It took about three minutes for them to get me the correct size sim card and I was still able to keep the same phone number.They also showed me how the slot for the memory card is stacked on top of the slot for sim 1.In short, yes this phone has dual sim slots as well as a memory card slot.If when I get back to Costa Rica and I can get the same service from ICE Cel, I am good to go.Phone came packaged with charger, ear bud and a very limited information start up guide.

BLU Energy X Plus Smartphone - With 4000 mAh Super Battery- US GSM Unlocked - Grey,BLU,139.0,3,"Bought for my son for Christmas with the intention of using AT&T. I took it to the AT&T store and they checked it all out and said it would work only for phone calls and texting but not for data because the firmware in the phone that has the settings for data that works with AT&T was outdated and would not work on their system. I looked at the BLU website and they tell you how to update to the latest android version on some of their phones but I see no way to upgrade the firmware that corresponds to all the phone carrier settings that would make it active on a SIM card. The phone itself is nice and my son really likes it so far, and I did get him a pay as you go phone and text plan from AT&T, but no data. Yes, I suppose I could send it back to try to get an updated phone but he has been using it for at about a week right after Christmas before I took it to AT&T and does not want to have to wait to get a replacement. He uses our wifi at home or school to get on-line. Really the bottom line is I should not have to send something back for being outdated that I just bought as new! Who wants to mess around with all that hassle? Had I known ahead of time I would not have gotten this phone, but I (my son) will live with it for now.So, I can only give this 3 stars for them selling a phone that is outdated. I took it to the AT&T store within 2-3 weeks of my purchase date since it was wrapped under the tree then he used it before I activated the phone, and it should not have had outdated firmware. Is anyone aware of how to get the firmware on line? I would have no problem updating it myself since I have done so on other non-phone devices but I see no way to do that from the BLU website.",0.0

"BlackBerry Classic Factory Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BlackBerry,149.99,2,l am a blackberry fan for a long time but now I don't like their poor performance in the telephone industry. they have lack of apps and instead of adding more features they take off the best feature that no one else ever has which was ON and OFF. That feature let the telephone to become on and off itself at the time you like. Now we have to do it Manually and that is not cool. The other issue blackberry has is that there is no an option to control Device Password and that is very vulnerable to steal. The thief all he has to do is to type wrong passwords only 10 time to own the phone then the security wipe will delete all the data on the device. The only thing good about blackberry is the calendar that you can do with everything you want like everyday 12345 and so on you name it.

BLU Energy X LTE - 4000 mAh Super Battery - GSM Unlocked - Gold,BLU,124.99,1,Have had several blu phones and loved them. This one is absolutely junk. First I noticed the crapy hard plastic case it comes with. Then I also noticed it came with hard plastic earbuds. All of the other blu phones i have had come with soft rubber cases that are great as well as earbuds with soft plastic tips. now it's not even 3 months old and the screen touch has gone crazy. It selects one spot over an over as long as there is something to be selected. I have tryed several things to fix it but still same issue. Only thing it is good for is my alarm as long as i dont need to change it an the clock on the lock screen.I'll give blu one more shot on the next phone.,0.0

"POSH Titan HD E500a - 5.0"" HD, 4G, Android 4.4 Kit Kat, Octa-core, 8GB , 13MP Camera, Ultra Slim, Dual Sim Smartphone (Black)",Posh Mobile,91.91,5,"So far this is the best phone I have ever bought with this reasonable price tag. 5'' display is excellent for playing games and watching videos. Though put it side by side with SGS4, it is not as vibrant as the S4, nevertheless with this price, it is a great display. Dual SIM slots is convenient for some folks who use two phone numbers. For me that brings no benefit at all. About the performance, there are no sign of lagging thus far. Everything runs smoothly thanks to Kit Kat version and 8 core processors. Further, for those who are interested in battery life, this phone is about average. The battery life cannot compare to SGS5, or Iphone 5 but it can last you a whole day if you are a light uses like I am. Additionally, external micro SD card is a plus. The back camera 13 megapixels is good but not quite good as the high end phones. Front facing camera on the other hand is interesting. 5 Megapixels is great for taking selfy if you are interested. To conclude, I have never heard of this brand (little worry) but so far this phone is giving me good experiences. For those who is currently looking for an alternative unlocked phone with reasonable price tag other than well known brands such as HTC, Samsung, or LG; Posh Titan HD E500 is the perfect everyday phone. It offers the best value with (as far as I am concern) up to date technology. Totally recommend for friends and family.",68.0

If you are looking for an unlocked phone make sure you know what kind of service your phone company uses; CDMA or GSM. Samsung makes the Galaxy line in both types but a GSM phone won't work on a CDMA system and vice versa.This phone came with the ATT logo on the back, having been manufactured for ATT; and also came pre-loaded with ATT apps and phone numbers. It was easy enough to delete those that were not applicable. My initial concern was that the serial number on the box didn't match the serial number on the phone; however that doesn't appear to matter because the phone works flawlessly.The battery life on the Galaxy S III is so much better than on my wife's Galaxy S II.",5.0

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,4,"I bought this phone for my teenage son who wanted a smartphone. I chose the quad band so he could take it overseas and use it there too. Since I wanted to use it with a T-Mobile pre-paid sim card, I needed to find a sim-lock free phone. The Samsung Galaxy Ace seemed perfect and it's features appealed to my son. Unfortunately, as we found out after only a few months, this phone has not good reception with the T-Mobile sim card. Most of the time it has no reception at all except for the 911 call. It might be a good phone with other providers but not with T-Mobile. The other features of the phone were fine. The camera was pretty decent too. The touch screen was not terribly responsive though.Edited review on 5/8/2015:after having this phone sit around for 18 months, I decided to find out why it would not work with my carrier (T-Mobile) despite being advertised as a GSM phone. I went to several cell phone repair shops which, of course, quoted outrageous prices for ""fixing"" it. One shop thought the contacts of the SIM card slot were bad; another blamed it on being an international (Canadian) model. The technician at Batteries and Bulbs even opened it up, free of charge, to look at the SIM card slot. He said that everything was in fine order. He indicated that it might have something to do with the phone's carrier settings. And that's what it was. It took me an afternoon of looking around but I finally figured it out. The setting had been on ""select automatically"" (either GSM or CDMA) when it should have been set to ""GSM"". After I made that change, no more problems! The phone works perfectly and has good cell reception all the time.",1.0

Here is a list of the specs and disadvantages (from GSMArena.com).-Specifications:Quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE supportQuad-band 3G with 21 Mbps HSDPA and 5.7 Mbps HSUPA support3.8"" 16M-color ClearBlack LCD display with WVGA resolution5 megapixel autofocus camera with LED flash, 720p@30fps video recordingVGA front-facing cameraWindows Phone 8 OS1.0 GHz dual-core Krait CPU, Adreno 305 GPU, 512 MB of RAMWi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n, dual-bandGPS receiver with A-GPS and GLONASS support8 GB of inbuilt storage, expandable through the microSD card slot (up to 64 GB)Active noise cancellation with a dedicated micBuilt-in accelerometer, gyroscope and proximity sensorStandard 3.5 mm audio jack1300 mAh user-replaceable batterymicroUSB port with file transfersBluetooth v3.0 with A2DP and EDRNFC supportFull Office Mobile experienceGreat build qualityFree lifetime voice-guided navigation via Nokia DriveExcellent social integrationXbox Live integration and Xbox managementNokia Music streaming serviceFM Radio7 GB worth of SkyDrive storageAttractive price-Main disadvantagesWP app catalog falls short of Android and iOSNo system-wide file managerNo lockscreen shortcutsRemoving the back panel is testingOverall (tl;dr): If you're looking at an affordable priced smartphone and like the Windows 8/8.1 OS better than Android/iOS, I suggest you buy this phone, one of the best smartphones you can get for the price; happy buying!",1.0

I will adjust this if they surprise me and either repair or replace my phones, but reading other reviews, it doesn't look like that will happen. I purchased two phones, one for myself and one for my daughter, and this was early on, when the reviews were still glowing, before everyone started having the exact same problems I am. I didn't expect an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy, but I expected, with the specs and reviews up until that point, last Christmas, to get a decently functioning smartphone at a good price. and for a few months, that's what we had. Then things started going downhill. My daughter's bettery went kaput. I could literally watch it drain away, percent by percent, in minutes. They did replace that with few hassles, after originally wanting me to send the whole phone back in (I refused knowing it was the battery and they did concede and send a new one). But then her phone started to only work on speaker. A month or so later, the same happened to mine. Ever so convenient when in a crowded place, to try to talk on speakerphone! And sometimes it doesn't even work. Mine also has become pixelated at the top and bottom of the screen. I have finally gotten a cheapo older model (though really, probably better) phone to use for awhile while I send these in to be fixed/replaced, one at a time. We will see if that happens, or if they just send them back claiming ""water damage"" or ""physical damage"" instead of manufacturer's defect, the only thing they cover. I fail to see how two phones can have the exact same problem that isn't a defect with the phone...and I've seen other reviews on here talking about the same issue. There hasn't been water or other physical damage to these phones. I do hope that I can adjust this review to be more positive but I don't hold a lot of hope...",

"ASUS ZenFone 3 Deluxe 5.5-inch 4GB RAM, 64GB storage Unlocked Dual SIM Cell Phone, US Warranty (ZS550KL-Glacier Silver)",,399.0,1,"My son owns the previous version of this phone (ZenFone 2) and he loves it. That phone never had any issues and worked great on our T-Mobile family plan. When my current phone died, I figured I would buy this phone to replace it. The specs looked great on it and since I had experience with the previous model, I assumed that I would get a better version by going to the new model. That was the wrong decision. I needed a phone quickly since my old one was about to die, so I paid for overnight shipping which did not happen. I finally got the phone after 2 days and I immediately turned it on and set it up. When I finally got it configured, I noticed that it was only connecting at 2G speeds (Edge). I was staying in a hotel at the time with spotty cell coverage, so I thought it must be the location. However, when I took the phone in the car and started driving around, it would never connect beyond 2G, so after spending 1 hour with Asus support and taking it to a T-Mobile store, they determined that the phone was defective and the recommendation was to return it to Amazon.I was willing to give Asus the benefit of the doubt and I just happened to get a dud. So I asked Amazon to replace it with a new one, which they did quickly (thanks Amazon) and I had a new one the next day.I quickly set up the new phone, and it worked!!! Yeah.... Not really. The replacement phone was able to connect to T-Mobile with no issues, but when I took it in the car and tried to use Google Maps, I was not able to get the screen to rotate to landscape mode.Getting back to my hotel, I started doing some research and downloaded a couple of apps to test all the sensors. I also went through the Asus sensor diagnostic tests (In case you are wondering, type "".12345+="" on the calculator app and you get the diagnostic screen). It turned out that the g sensor on the phone was NOT working correctly. Because of this, the phone was not able to detect when it had to auto rotate applications to landscape mode.This was just the last straw... Obviously, Asus seems to have some serious problems with this phone and the QC on them. So, as it stands now. I am returning the replacement phone and getting my money back.",15.0

I did a review on that one also.Starting off with this one seemed very familiar with my previous life XL.Here's my negatives so far after a month and a half.1) Notifications (again) Most of my app notifications do not sound. They worked for a while, now most don't.Don't know if it's me or the phone. I some cases, I will set a tone and after hitting ok, it will reset to none.2) incoming calls. There is supposed to be a drop down Dismiss/Answer box to handle the call.Most of the time it doesn't show up, or if it's hidden, I don't know how to open it. Really frustrating.3) Still don't know if connecting LTE, no icon I can see. I'm assuming it does.4) there are only 2 pages available for apps? Not a big negative for me, as the app icon at the bottom is now back (missing on the vivo xl)5) I also had trouble connecting to windows to get pictures off (same with vivo xl). Found solutions online. Should be simple plug in featurePluses.I did find a 64gb card that worked.SanDisc.

"Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679",Samsung,119.99,2,"This is a very nice no-contract phone. I'm sure it doesn't compare to those dual-core latest/greatest android phones, but its a good price for a decent phone. A couple of things I wanted to highlight. First of all, there is a big discussion about whether or not you can activate the $30 plan [100 minutes, 5GB of 4G data] susposedly exclusive to walmart when you buy the phone from here. Now, I can't say that you can do it in all circumstances, but let me just say that it is possible since I was able to do this. All I did was follow the tmobile online activation. I didn't call anyone (I don't think you can do it if you call, unless you pester them into doing it for you). I also activated a temporary number, but plan to transfer my virgin mobile number later. You don't need to buy an activation kit from tmobile.com, you can use the one that came with the phone.*PROS*-Display Screen is very nice. Coming from a 3.2 inch Optimus V.-Phone is fast (1 Ghz). You won't see much lag if any.-Wifi speed is fast. (I compared it to other phones and this one consistenly is faster)-Size is perfect for pocket. (Same size as Optimus V but thinner with larger screen)-Front facing camera for chat. (Works with Skype/google voice)*CONS*-No zoom on the back camera-pictures are a bit grainy with the back camera. (3.2 Megapixels - a bit disappointing)-4G connection is slow. The best I've seen is 800 mbps download. I was getting much better on 3G from Virgin Mobile.-Takes forever to charge. I think 4+ hours from 0% to 100%Updated 04/02/12:The screen brightness on this phone outdoor is horrible. It is worse than my Optimus V. At lowest brightness setting, I can't see anything outdoor and can't enter my screen lock code. This was not a problem on the Optimus V. At the brightest setting, I can barely make things out. The Optimus V screen is brighter than this one. The could be a deal breaker for me so might have to return the phone. No argument about the display indoor...it looks really nice.

"ASUS ZenFone Zoom Unlocked Cellphone, 64GB, Black (U.S. Warranty)",Asus,399.0,5,"Update #2 (7/10/2016)Okay, another update on this phone. I still love it. Its extremely fast and excellent at multitasking. I have developed a couple of complaints about the phone.First, and this is not the phone's fault at all, there are not any really good cases available for the phone to offer really good protection. The only types of cases I have found are the silicone skins and the wallet style. So, that's kind of a bummer.Second, the approximately 1/3"" space at the bottom of the phone is kind of a pain, only because the capacitive buttons are higher than you would expect them to be. Sometimes I can be in the middle of typing a text message or something else, and I accidentally press the ""home"" button, and my phone zips to the home screen. Of course, I just press the ""tasks"" button and re-open my app, and I can quickly resume what I was doing. But, I shouldn't have to do that.Other than that, the battery life is more than adequate for my needs. Call quality is good. I have dropped the phone at least twice, with it only having an aforementioned silicone case, and there was no damage whatsoever.I love the phone and I am much happier with it than I was the MotoX.I will update if I have any problems that develop or if something terrible happens that causes me to need a new phone. Thanks for reading!Update (4/28/2016) : I still love this phone. I have discovered that the notification light only works with the phone is NOT on silent. It somewhat defeats the purpose for my needs, but not a deal breaker. The camera is stellar, and works extremely well. I am quite pleased with it. There was a firmware update that seems to have improved battery life as well as screen brightness. I am very happy with this. I love the ""Do It Later"" app that comes on the phone, allows you to set reminders to call and text people back, save articles to read, etc. Also, the phone has the ability to record telephone conversations. While the legality of doing this without the other party's consent varies from state to state, it can be VERY useful for helping you to remember exactly what was said in a conversation (a doctor's instructions, a step by step process being explained to you by another, etc.).So far, the phone still gets 5 stars from me. Will update again soon.(Original review):Posting a review since no one else has yet. A review would have been helpful to me when I was trying to decide whether or not to buy this phone. I was debating between this and the ZenFone 2. Most specs are the same, with a couple of exceptions. This phone supposedly has a better camera with optical image stabilization and 3x zoom. I am not a camera guru and won't claim to be, but so far its okay. I will update when I have had more time to play with it and experience its strengths and weaknesses. BUT I believe that Asus has also upgraded the sound in this phone (it sounds good) and this phone has Gorilla Glass 4. GG4 is supposedly 85% stronger than GG3. So to me it was worth it. Now better screen protection may not be a big issue for some, most people put cases on their phones anyway. I usually do too. However, no good, protective cases have been developed for this phone yet. So in the meantime, I feel better knowing i have better screen protection. Everything else? I like the phone. A lot of people complain about bloatware. I couldn't care less. I prefer some extra apps to the minimalist, bare bones, stock Android experience. If you don't like bloat, you can disable and hide the apps. And the bloatware doesn't affect the speed of the phone. This thing is a beast. Its super fast and snappy and I like it. I am a major multitasker and have huge numbers of apps running at any given time. This thing never slows down. It even does well with apps that I have on my SD card. I initially had some trouble getting the notification light to work, and the first day I had it some of my calls and texts didnt come through. I did a factory reset and no issues since. That's all for now. Will update in a few weeks.",47.0

Tried a few china ones but they just wouldn't ""hold"" signal with my USA provider, so that idea was out. I looked for a small phone instead: something that could fit inside my beeper pocket in my jeans.This thing does, and does so _sideways_.Impossibly small, amazingly cute, totally functional. Cell signal is stronger than with my Samsung Note 3. Battery life is all day assuming you kill running apps, otherwise mine ran ""warm"" and the battery drained fairly quickly. I rooted it with kingroot (had to sideload via SD) and now have a perfectly functioning micro cell phone without any bloatware. I also installed setCPU and clocked it down to 800MHz to improve battery life.. OH, and install ""display brightness"" (looks like a light bulb) and turn on negative brightness to extend battery time even more. The thing is _amazingly_ bright.With these tweaks, the phone has remained at the same percentage for the last 2 hours. (most bloat can be killed with kingroot or frozen with titanium backup)I also installed APEX launcher, much slicker interface than stock.As noted, KEEP the charge cable handy, it's non-standard and the plug-in part is ""longer"" than most cables you're sure to have. I'm sure spares can be ordered on amazon.Bluetooth paired and worked perfectly as I listened to music for hours on a bike ride: sounded great.FULL 4G (well, technically 3.5G) speeds and wifi-hotspot capable (I used foxfi) . . . no complaints whatsoever on call quality / data speeds.The speaker is stunningly good for such a little critter.Netflix streams like butter and looks so impossibly cute.The screen is not high-rez, but does the job perfectly because of the tiny screen size.I am absolutely stunned that these are not more popular. Everyone I showed mine to wanted one. I can throw it in the back of my jersey and hit the road, or slip it in my beeper pocket and forget it. And if I need amazon prices while standing in walmart or a quick glance at the radar? Yep, perfect, fast. LOVE ITEDIT: after a normal day of calendar additions / phone calls /etc.. I went the full day and still had 82% battery.That number is slightly mis-leading as once you hit 14% you can watch it drain to zero and power off, Seriously, you can count the percentages down like they are seconds.Also, the rom has one problem on it, if you use a program to try and automatically change the ringtone (any program: like phone schedule or anything) it will crash whatever program was attempting to do it.

Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - Black - 16GB - U.S. Warranty,Motorola,249.0,1,"Phone was delivered Sept 30 2016. When purchasing anything on Amazon my personal policy is to extensively research the reviews and especially the one star reviews. If the 1 stars are less than 12% I make the purchase as long as there are no feature related negatives that turn me off. The hardware negatives/failures for this phone were like most cell phones and as such I gave it a shot since the 1 stars were at around 9%. Let's face it, mass produced electronics WILL have bad apples from ALL manufacturers. With that being said I've gotten less than 90 days of reliable performance from this phone. It's been 2 months and 10 days and the phone has been excellent up until a few days ago. Like a large majority of the negatives this phone is now suffering the same fate. The screen goes bat sh*t crazy out of the blue, opening apps randomly as if it's been possessed by a demon. At this late date I figure it's entirely possible. So I downloaded a number of anti -malware, virus, trojan, root programs from Google Play store to try and make sure it wasnt exclusively software (OS) related. Phone is clean. Did a hard reset etc. Removed all apps. STILL fing up. One thing I have noticed is the phone has had the tendency to run really hot lately. HEAT = death for CPUs. Even low cycle, high tolerance phone CPUs which have zero external cooling capabilities are vulnerable if maxed by default. Which this one is. And once a CPU ""cooks"" it can begin to produce all kinds of software related issues. Which APPEAR to be ONLY software related (ie..crazy screen, locking up, rebooting, etc). And the reality is, these issues ARE OS related, but only in the sense that the RAM can't accurately process ""cooked data"" so....the phone freaks. Unfortunately, once a CPU has been heated past its safe ""thermal threshold"" for an extended period of time, the device is on borrowed time at best or just refuses to function correctly and is rendered a paperweight at worst. Right now this phone is being shelved as an emergency back up. It still functions MOST of the time. Which for me, is unacceptable. This is what happens when a manufacturer pushes the performance limit for their hardware and has ""less than meticulous"" quality control at the Lenova factory level. So...Form Factor/Appearance/Weight = B+Features and INITIAL impression = AMaterials Quality and Construction = D - (MY purchase)Short term reliability (180 days) = D -Long term reliability = Don't make me laugh",0.0
Moto G Play (4th gen.) - Black - 16 GB - Unlocked - Prime Exclusive - with Lockscreen Offers & Ads,Motorola,149.99,4,"For what it's supposed to be--a budget phone, it does a good job. Except for a couple notable annoyances, I'd give it 5 stars.First of all, though, the Prime Exclusives factor is no annoyance at all--not even intrusive in the least. The first annoyance: the stuttering audio when switching between earphone and speakerphone; basically, you get no audio, then the stuttering audio as it returns to full volume--cutting in and out before normal audio returns, lasts 3 or 4 seconds; this is apparently typical of the G4 Play according to published reviews on some sites. The second annoyance: the display only ""wakes"" (aka ""breathing"" alerts) for 2 seconds periodically instead of the 5 seconds that's normal with just about any other Android phone, even other Moto G versions; 2 seconds isn't enough to read any notification, let alone respond to it unless you're all prepared to wake the phone fully; there's a bit of a stutter here, too, as the display doesn't get fully bright before going off again.Still, the Moto family is very close to stock Android, so I'd still get one again--the Moto G4 (not Play) especially (maybe next time). When all is said and done, it works very well for the primary purpose for which I got it: an Android smartphone running Google Hangouts using my Google Voice number for wi-fi calling at home.",

Nokia N8 Unlocked GSM Touchscreen Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation and 12 MP Camera (Silver/White),Nokia,99.99,1,This phone even though unlocked does not recognize any SIM CARD here in the US. It doesn't come with a manual that shows the features. I wasted my money on this phone. I am hoping I'll be able to use it outside US when I travel.I had to pay $35.00 to remove a SIM card that got stuck in one of the slots. I do not recommend the phone to anyone. The phone is very complicated to open according to expert Phone repairer here in Los Angeles. I wonder what to do when the Battery needs a replacement when I travel abroad or give it to someone outside US (which I intend to do). I would have returned the phone if I had opened the package early enough during the window I'm permitted to return. This is a second time I bought an item from AMAZON that I can't use. First time was my SONY Laptop replacement Battery. If it happens again I will go to Ebay instead. I am getting disappointed with Amazon products.,0.0

The numbers in your telephone contacts and your text messaging is in a ridiculously small font which is not adjustable. The font is so small that I can barely make it out when I am wearing my reading glasses, and impossible to read without them. Microsoft apparently has no intention of fixing this problem, as they recently released a software update which allows you to adjust the size of the huge tiles, but not the tiny font. I guess they don't bother to read any of the feedback on the Nokia, or Microsoft Phone websites, where many people have complained about this problem. Additionally, the little cover over the USB charging port broke about two weeks after I bought the phone. This would not be a huge problem, except that without the usb cover in place, the other cover over the SIM card and the battery is loose, and comes off easily (very poor design). I regret not doing my homework better before buying this phone.",0.0

"BLU Studio 6.0 Unlocked Cellphone, White",BLU,971.6,1,Very flaky device. Music whether streaming or playing from SD card cuts in and out. Received a notice to perform an OTA update and the phone won't install the update. Blu support both email and phone are no help. They now claim I modified the phone so they won't cover/fix the problem on warranty. Other than adding apps and performing a previous OTA update I've done nothing to the phone. Very dissatisfied. I've found out that I can root the phone but it won't help because there is no custom recovery or alternate ROMs. I guess I'm screwed. Luckily the rest of the phone is working ok. I'll just have to live with it since my eyesight is failing and I need a 6 inch phone. I'll save up and find a better 6 inch phone when I can afford it. I'll never buy a Blu product again.UPDATE: The phone now will not boot. It started having display issues so I tried rebooting it and it stopped at the Blu logo screen and sits there doing nothing else. Blu Mobile has already accused me of modifying the software so they won't honor the warranty. This is the worst product experience I have ever had. I've had the phone since April 25 and it is now June 4. Only a month and a half and nothing but trouble. Some things are too good to be true!,3.0

Received the phone quickly. Amazon does a great job with shipping...if they tell you 2 days, it will be 2, if they say 3-5 days, you might get it in 4. The phone is not heavy. Like the apps, but wished there were more like what the iPod and iPhone has. Love the Map, I can download just about any country and it actually shows you where you are without been online and it talks to you while you drive when you put in where you want to go. I had to go away, so I tried it outside of the USA and it still shows you where you actually are. If you need to download the entire USA, you'll need a larger capacity Micro SD card...the USA is large, but you could download which state you need or just search for the address...as I said you don't need to be online to do this.Sometimes when you are at a particular screen it freezes and you have to turn off the phone or the phone turns off without you doing it, otherwise it's okay. For the price, it has a little of everything and some extras that other phones don't have. WIFI is great, I can pick up WIFI virtually anywhere.I had one problem, I could not find any cover and screen protective films except in the UK or China, so now I have to wait for the package. Amazon had two types from another company, which I only liked one and they only had one color available and I need more colors.

"BLU Studio 6.0 Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,292.99,5,"UPDATED REVIEW (5-12-2015) I have now had this phone over four months. The original screen cover is still perfect and I have the spare still on hand that comes with the phone. You also get a great rubber case and I have dropped the phone onto carpet several times or off our bed which is 45"" off the ground. I love this phone and would recommend it to anyone. The battery life is still excellent and the battery is removeable so you can replace it (if you have security concerns you can remove the battery and drain the remaining power by holding the buttons for about 10 seconds). The phone gets better battery life if you remove active apps by holding down the primary button for about 3-4 seconds and you just swipe them away so they are stopped - I do this after every use for the apps I am not going to need the rest of the day; I reboot once or twice a week. This has been the best phone for my needs in the past four years (during which time I had Sony, HTC One, Samsung 3/4, Apple 4, and two versions of the Nokia Windows phones). This is simply a wonderful phone at a price that cannot be beat. I stand by my earlier impressions.Amazon offers free replacement and free shipping for returns if you don't like it - read their policy (Free Replacement before returning) is perfect. As long you don't run more than 15 apps all the time it has good battery life - about 6 hours; if you shut down wifi and bluetooth when not needed you get 8-12 hours with your screen brightness set to auto. I love this phone - and it does everything for me I expect having had previously (Sony, HTC One, Samsung 4G, Nokia Windows phones).I recommend this phone- the replacement process at Amazon is flawless - return a phone within 30-days and never a problem and you do not pay shipping if phone defective. I have switched out several poor performing phones. TAKE A CHANCE, you will not be disappointed.",12.0

Pandaoo Smart Watch Mobile Phone DZ09 Unlocked Universal GSM Bluetooth 4.0 Music Player Camera Calendar Stopwatch Sync with Android Smartphones(Silver),Pandaoo,69.99,4,"Hey, it works well (in a somewhat limited form) but it goes comatose every now and then. The display degenerates into a mish-mosh of tiny pixels. The price was right. It doesn't do much but what it can perform it does. My first app to utilize was Bluetoothing my phone to it. Surprise! That works wonderfully. It is much better than the more expensive paired speaker on my sun visor. I have to set the time manually since I didn't SIM it. My only additional complaint (other than its untimely comas) is the tiny-ness of the icons. Touching them with my adult fingers is well nigh impossible. I finally found a tiny stylus that works for me. My wife does caution that it bears such a close resemblance to a real fitness watch that I may get mugged for a knockoff. Incidentally, I believe the cause of its periodic coma-like nap is static discharge when I put the watch on while wearing rubber soled shoes. The cure is to leave the watch unplugged until the battery totally discharges, then plug it in and turn it on.",0.0

It has a dull anodized aluminum look and the shade of red is just right. The phone looks great and I am glad I didn't go for the tepid white or the faceless but neutral black (black even costs a lot more on amazon, for some reason).It updated as soon as I got it to 4.1.2 with some fixes and late June, another update took it to 4.2.2. The phone has radio capable of HSPA+ and LTE on almost all network operators in the USA, at least. The battery life is average for the phone on usage; the standby life is pretty good. The screen is gorgeous. The Sony customization is minimal and I like the themes it ships with. It has nice walkman, album and video ( and reader) apps. Call and sound Q are good. You can receive calls without unlocking.The phone is worth the money. I had considered HTC one (google play) edition for its hardware/build quality but it does not have 1700 Mhz support for HSPA.

"CNPGD [U.S. Office Extended Warranty] Smartwatch + Unlocked Watch Cell Phone All in 1 Bluetooth Watch for iPhone Android Samsung Galaxy Note,Nexus,htc,Sony Silver",CNPGD,49.99,3,"My son wanted a watch. So, I researched all over amazon's choices. This watch seemed to be excellent. It came in, I didn't even open it, just gave it to my son, excited. He's 14 and a tech junkie. He took one look at it and tossed it aside. He's about 6 feet tall and a big guy. So, it shocked me to hear him say that the watch was not for him. He said the watch face, itself, is much too huge, too thick, too big for him to wear. He didn't like it so much that he disregarded any tech capabilities on it, altogether and wasn't interested in it any further. He left on the table beside him and didn't give it a second look even though I advised him all it could do. Nope, not even remotely interested because it was too big. I tried to attach a photo to show you why the thickness is an issue with him. I've still not used the item and the purchase was a long time ago. I'm keeping it though, hoping that one day, it will be useful to me. I'm thinking it may be useful for jogging purposes. But, I, really, can't speak up on it. I haven't used it. No one wants to wear such a thick faced watch. So, the technical features have not, yet, been experienced. So, if, I do take the time to find someone to use it, I will be sure to update you on that. The three stars is only that no one wants to wear it.",8.0

I've never damaged the phone, not even a screen scratch. The phone refuses to turn on. Took it to a repair shop and they couldn't fix it. They said they get the problem a lot and have only been able to fix 1.(((((Its problem is a boot loop. Look it up in conjunction with the G4)))))The international version (H815), especially, is prone to it apparently. Didn't know that when I bought it, and 9 months later I'm out almost $500 (what I paid earlier.) Since this junk has no warranty, LG can't/won't repair or replace it.The phone was great while it worked, especially the camera. Everything else was par with the other flagship phones now (Galaxy, Note..).In short, you may think your phone won't have this problem, but whatcha gonna do if it does? There's no warranty and it's unrepairable. You'll lose everything that wasn't backed up (like I did).

CNPGD All-in-1 Watch Cell Phone & Smart Watch Sync to Android IOS Smart Phone (Silver Plus),,49.99,4,"Just got the watch and I have to say I like it! it is slightly thick but not terrible. The only gripe I have for now is the setup to my phone. WHAT A PAIN IN THE ASS.. it will connect but then it doesnt pair. After an hour of putzing with it, I found out the best thing to do is install the software using the QR Code on the watch (very cool by the way) then pair with the phone. Unpair with the phone. Turn off the BT on the watch and the phone. Turn the BT back on on both devices then connect. Viola! it starts working. The remote camera option is cool if not a little creepy. Seems like it could be used for less than legal practices.. I will use and report back further issues.. If Any..EDIT: 1 Week review..So I have had this watch for a week and would like to update you on my findings. After trying all the features i have come to the conclusion that this is still a fun device to have. The sleep monitor, Working but always says poor nights sleep. I am assuming it uses the motion sensor for this and how much you move during the night. As i am a restless sleeper, the watch is spot on.. Connection to the phone: This is where the watch lacks. Patience is a virtue on this. It will connect and stay connected as long as you are in range of your phone. 10 or more feet in a normal setting. I have noticed any location that has metal studs or office environment, The range is 2-3 feet at best. Not a big deal since they have crammed so much into this watch that the antenna for BT couldn't be very large. If it does drop, simply touch the messages button and touch connect and it will reconnect. It will bring up all the notifications it missed while disconnected and it does do almost ALL notifications including facebook. It only will bring up contacts and messages it you choose the bluetooth option for each on the watch. IT DOES NOT SAVE ANYTHING TO THE WATCH. It has to download contacts and messages each time you choose it. Depending on your phone it can take a few seconds. Cell phone option: I didn't get a chance to ry this but i did put a SIM card in and it picked up the network fine. For those of you who cant get the browser to work, It only works with the cell service. The watch does not pull the internet from your phone. The Pedometer: Works great but does have a delay. Not a big deal since you arent staring at the watch while you walk. It will catch up. Finally the software setup.. I have tried many sotwares in the hope the watch will stay connected. I have decided the watch is to blame for the distance (not a deal breaker). Do not use the QR code on the watch as the software it installs is an old version. Simply go to the play store and search ""Bluetooth Notification"" and install. The best part is you don't need to turn off any security. Also it is the same software that is on the watch but with updates through the store and a newer version. Open the app and turn it on. Then simply Pair the watch.. MAKE SURE YOU INSTALL THE SOFTWARE FIRST BEFORE PAIRING! In conclusion, this watch is very comfortable on the wrist and is a little think but not terrible. My only major gripe besides the connection issues is the fact that the USB port on the watch is NOT covered. I have found myself being very careful around water (washing hands, rain etc.) the port faces your hand and is very easy to get water in there. Don't be discouraged, the watch is $40 so the little things are tolerable. Have fun with it and don't expect a Moto 360. It is what it is and does a great job doing it!",15.0

"Apple iPhone 5s AT&T Cellphone, 16GB, Silver",Apple,139.95,5,"I have to write a review for this phone. I love it! I had always used Samsung and LG products since I got my first cell phone. When smart phones came into the scene I had to wait for them to become affordable for the general tight was public. I have to admit, my first smart phone was an iPhone 4s because it was already being discontinued and was free when I renewed my contract. It was so easy to use that I was instantly hooked! I was 49 years old but not computer illiterate. I had always loved photography and would often take pictures of the sunrise on my way home from work. People on Facebook couldn't believe my pics were taken with an iPhone. Then the Xperia z1 came out with 20.7 megapixel. I wanted to fuze the 2 together and thought this was the perfect option. I was wrong. Within 3 months I was scouring the internet looking for another iPhone. I found this phone. From the instant I pulled it out of the box I was in love all over again. It has such a solid balanced feel to it. Not HEAVY heavy. Just a solid reassuring feel. The ease of use, as opposed to Android phones. still amazes me. The pictures are decent, but I kept my Xperia just for the camera. I hate carrying 2 phones around. Especially since the Xperia is bulky and HEAVY. They now have a compact version, but I can't afford to change phones whenever someone get a good idea! My iPhone is easy to use and you don't get ""launcher overload""!

New Nokia Lumia 1320 GSM Unlocked LTE Windows 8 Cell Phone - Black (No Warranty),Nokia,99.99,4,"Well first I am a person who makes a review after a good couple of weeks of using it and in this case it was well over a couple of months. Also, I am very computer savvy person (if you know what I mean...)It is fast smooth and certainly feels like a great phone! The main downsides are that its an international version (thus does not work with 4G or LTE or 3G for that fact) but it still works with 2G (note: I use T-Mobile). Now I know there is a variant of a United States model of this phone which is called the RM-995 model version and that is another $100 more than this one (I bought this one for $350). Now I know its not fair to judge a phone because of its these kinds of limitation but the loss of a ""star"" is because of the lack of support from the company when I asked it some simple questions (such as does this work for T-Mobile and does 4G/LTE/3G work)...but over all it is an awesome phone and I do not regret my decision buying this phone!",22.0
"ZTE Axon 7 unlocked smartphone,64GB Grey (US Warranty)",ZTE,399.99,4,"***Note that I bought this phone and I am providing an honest and unbiased review. It took some time for this phone to reach to me and I needed almost two weeks to try it out.With that being said, I bought this phone as an upgrade to my Galaxy S4. I must say, it is possibly one of the best purchases I have made in quite some time. I took a chance with a brand I have never used before and just heard of recently. Now let me tell you my likes and dislikes of the phone.Likes:1) Design - The phone is quite beautiful, the all metal design is a sight to behold. While it is not the thinnest nor lightest phone among the competition, you can't deny that the design is quite good compared to other phones. It can be slippery in the hand so a case is necessary. The curve at the back makes it really nice to hold in the hand and more comfortable. The front facing speakers are also a great addition for superb audio.2) Screen - The Quad HD screen is extremely beautiful. Watch 4k content on the phone is a blessing and it is clear and vivid. I love the more natural color tones compared to the overblown ones on Super AMOLED displays like the Samsung phones. At 5.5 inches, the more screen space is great for playing games, watching videos and browsing the web.3) Battery - Battery life is as good as I expected. With moderate use I could go over a day on a single charge. Be warned though that apps like Facebook and Snap Chat will drain the battery more than normal, especially with mobile data on. With Quick Charge 3.0, I can get 50% charge in 30 minutes and you can get a full charge in 1 1/2 hours. The Battery saving options are excellent as you can choose which apps boot up during specific situations and can see which apps consume battery power so you can choose to disable them or delete them.4) Software - Some people complained about the software. I am not too picky about it. The lack of an app drawer using the MiFavor theme is a major letdown. However, the Stock Android theme works well and almost feels like I'm using a Nexus. Overall, I may change it to Nova Launcher sometime in the future. The numerous gestures and gimmicks are a nice add on.5) Performance - The phone is quick and rarely lags. Games play buttery smooth (be sure to restart the device when you download a new game so that you can avoid possible app crashes). I have yet to put a graphically intensive game on the phone but pocket mortys and looney toons runner work well. Switching between apps is a breeze as well.6) Audio - The highlight of this phone is the audio capabilities. The front facing speakers, the Dolby Atmos and the audio chips inside provide an audio experience which, in my opinion, can match up to portable speakers. Listening to music and watch movies is very immersive. On higher volumes, sound is still crisp and clear. This by far surpasses the single speaker which my Galaxy S4 had.7) Call Quality - So far making calls has been an enjoyable experience. Call volume is good with the receiver being able to hear me clearly.8) Fingerprint Scanner - The fingerprint scanner is fast and unlocks the phone quickly and up to 95% of the time. Ensure that your fingers are not sweaty nor greasy as it may not register due to that.Dislikes:1) Camera - The camera is essentially not bad. In good lighting, the camera takes very decent pictures with nice color accuracy. However, its downfall is in low lighting. Pictures come out underexposed and noise and graininess is very apparent. Compared to the flagship competition, the camera is only as good as mid-range devices. The camera feature and settings really give you great control over the camera on manual mode and the slow motion setting is quite a pleasure to use.2) Off screen buttons - The Home, Back and Recent Apps navigation buttons are not screen and are capacitive buttons just above the lower speaker. They are not illuminated, thus in the dark the buttons are nearly impossible to see and make out. In time you can know where they are, but this is a red flag in my book. I really wish the option of on screen navigation buttons was available along with the option to change the placement/functionality of the off screen buttons.3) Gestures - Some of the features/gestures present on the phone are quite useful, such as the voice assistant and the auto call. However, the others are very finicky and are not very accurate. For example, I used my voice as a way to unlock the phone. I used a phrase as a password and only my voice can unlock the phone. My girlfriend tried and the phone did not recognize her as its master. While it worked for me at first, it soon was a hit and miss with it having a hard time figuring out I was the master. As I said, you can try and experiment with them all, but don't be disappointed if some don't work as intended.Final Thoughts:At a price of $400, you are basically getting a phone that can definitely compete with flagship phones like the Galaxy S7 Edge, the LG V20 and the IPhone 7. Even though the camera is only okay and the lack of illumination to the off screen navigation button and finicky gestures is a bit of a letdown, you cannot deny that for the price, this phone is something you won't regret buying and is something I can see myself using for the next 2 to 4 years. Frankly, if more phones at this price like this can come out, we won't need to shell out an arm and a leg for the top brands.",12.0

A gentleman told me I should return the device. I did not wanted to return it. I was thinking, these sings might be because of costums in usa. Usually officers are checking few devices randomly and I was thinking my device is one of them. I decided to keep it few more days. If there is no problem, I would not return.

"Samsung Galaxy S5 SM-G900A GSM Unlocked Cellphone, 16GB, Black",Samsung,234.0,4,"So far, so good. I hesitate to give five stars, simply because I've only had this phone for a week. My primary concern with this kind of purchase, as is demonstrated in some reviews with such products, is whether this previous generation of smartphone is truly new and authentic. Once the newest and hottest smartphone version hits the market, any remaining new stock of the previous version is discontinued or swiped up fast (particularly if the previous version is better than the newest). As anyone who has been looking for these models can attest, a lot of the options are refurbished, open-box, unlocked, or most importantly claimed as new but not really. Then you have the issue with whether the model is ""international"", GSM or something else that might prevent it from doing what the buyer wants it to do.So, I'm happy that I found this at a reasonable price and from a seller that I was able to research and develop some confidence in. I was also able to rely on the Amazon return policy in case things didn't work out. BlutekUSA is the seller, in my case, and I have been quite happy with the result. I believe the phone is indeed new, and perhaps even factory-unlocked versus the seller doing it. And it is the real deal, with all the standard, original accessories included.The phone itself works quite well, compared to my Galaxy S3. I have T-Mobile, and this is an AT&T unlocked phone (that's what the ""A"" means, in the G900A model), but I was able to simply take my SIM out of my old phone and insert it into the new phone, do some manual setting of the 4G ling so that I could highlight and pick T-Mobile (more networks, mobile networks, APN setting to T-Mobile), and everything works fine. The performance is improved. The battery is stronger, longer lasting and recharges much faster than the Galaxy S3. It was already updated to Android 5.0 Lollipop, and while not a rooted device, I'm satisfied with the operation.",2.0

BLU Energy X LTE - 4000 mAh Super Battery - GSM Unlocked - Black,BLU,125.95,1,"good phone. currently using it as a backup. great for low intensity use! unfortunately, I am not a low intensity user. The device only has 1gb of ram which causes the phone to pause for 5 seconds at a time when surfing. probably due to all those automated predictions the browser or google is doing. Sometimes apps don't feel like they start up fast enough. Touches dont register too well. yeah, I know I can clear the apps in the background, but doing that every time i want dcent perfornance... No thanks.Aside from that, if you bought this phone ONLY for battery life then you've come to the right place! Even after long 16 hour day I still had 60% left. I had an zenfone 2 which would be around 10% after the usage I put this thing through. My use largely consists of YouTube videos and music using the WiFi and a Bluetooth headset, podcasts and some web surfing. 4 - 6 hours usage after a day with power left over.4G, wifi and phone antennas all work just fine. bars are consistenly on the high side.Poor performance from bluetooth.The Bluetooth connection skips on a regular basis with ALL types of audio. Downloaded music, podcasts, streaming. Additionally, when watching YouTube videos you can see the audio is not in sync and audio stutters every few seconds. Its not the headset, because I tried it with some Bluetooth speakers and I heard the distinct skips/stutters there too. BT speakers tend to hide skips better but theyre still there. (update 6/3/16)No skips when using a 3.5mm male/male cable to speakers or wired headphones.before I forget....it comes packaged with a USB cable, some paperwork, a plastic screen protector and a hard plastic case. you'll need the latter as the phone is slippery as glass. feels hefty and quite solid in hand(non-removable 4000mah battery).",

"HTC A8181 Desire Unlocked Quad-Band GSM Phone with Android OS, HTC Sense UI, 5 MP Camera, Wi-Fi and gps navigation--International Version with Warranty (Brown)",HTC,225.18,5,"As most of the people writting, it is in fact a great android phone, brother of the Nexus One. AMOLED vs SLCD=> No sense to compare. But potential buyers, specially those located outside the US, must be warned of the fact that international version mean that one item will be randomly taken from stock and shipped to you..and its configuration can be to anyplace , japanesse, chinesse, and in my unfortunatelly case, for arabian market. The difference is the preloaded applications through ROM memory. I bought an international version thinking that maybe, the cellphone could come with some spanish apps or otherwise some european apps (like language system, news, etc.). But when I received the apparatus and turned it on, Problems started. First: Only two languages to choose for operating system; English/Arabic. Fortunately I understand some english and said 'its ok but wish i have found spanish option'. Second: Found some muslim apps, at ROM level and it means that I cannot remove it, Specially one irritating program which reminds the muslim pray time by ""singing"" a chorus and there were no way to make it to stop neither by forcing it to stop through settings. It made me to be on the verge of flashing the OS. Fortunatelly, and looking through the Web I found the way to make a soft reset and now the program is still there but inactive. Third: Apps related with weather, time and world clock had preloaded arabic cities. In this case it was relatively easy to remove and change cities. Finally, I found some additional apps to compose with spanish dictionary. Finally today I'm fine with the device but after one week of thoroughly visit forums, setting it, etc.I suggest that everybody interested in one of this device, just buy domestic version. After all, I'm sure that ironically, it comes with spanish language option and whatever apps it brings, it always will be closer for europe and latinamerica than this ""International version"".",1.0

I thought my phone ☎ was ruined FOR SURE!! Furthermore， how in the HECK was I going to get to it!! It was now，more than likely, at the bottom of the elevator shaft?? My apt manager called the elevator company and they said they charged 150 USD to send a technician to come open the shaft to investigate!!! Hmmm! Should I pay the 150 USD only to find my LG G3 broken into pieces? Well， It was cheaper than buying a new phone ☎ and I was curious， so I went for it. When they opened up the elevator shaft my phone was laying there in 3 pieces.

There is a slight gash above the center piece on the top bezle but the angle and fact that it mainted its white paint make it barely noticeable!! Its still looks and works as if it were BRAND NEW!!

"Apple iPhone 6 Plus 128GB Factory Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Smartphone, Space Gray (Certified Refurbished)",,482.92,3,Bought a refurbished iPhone 6 Plus from this guys. My thoughts after a few weeks:The Good: Unit is in good condition. No visible wear or tear. Set up was easy.The Bad: The battery does not hold a charge the same way brand new one would. I expected this - Batteries lose potency over time. But I was not expecting how worn out the this battery would be. The unit I received has battery life comparable to my 2 year old iPhone 5s. I bought form this seller because I thought their higher prices would better quality reburbs. Oh well.Conclusion:-Buying a refurbished iPhone 6 Plus from this seller saved me $100. But I more than paid for it by not getting Apple's warranty (This seller offers a 90 day warranty) and I will have to replace this unit's worn out battery in a few months.,2.0

I really wanted the Nexus product since I will get the security updates for Android that all of the other carriers seem to avoid deploying so they can make more money on the upgrade cycle. There is one suggestion I would make ... it comes with an international power adapter, a USB-C to USB-C cable, and a kludgy converter to plug in to US sockets. I think it would be better to just give people the USB-C to USB-C cable and then a USB-C to USB-A adapter.

BLU S480U Unlocked Studio 7.0 II Smartphone with 5MP Main Camera (Gold),BLU,,2,"Reason I got this phone: So even though I am very well versed in phones of just about every kind (I own multiple Android phones, Windows Phones, and iPhone 6, a Z10, a Fire Phone, etc), I did not realize that anyone had put out a 7 inch phone. When I noticed it was under $150, I went ahead and made the purchase. I understood that the specs were fairly low and that it wasn't going to blow me away. As long as everything worked as expected, albeit slower than my G Flex 2, I felt this would be a fun phone to use from time to time when I didn't want to carry a tablet and a phone. Did it live up to my ""just work"" expectations?I generally find ""pro"" and ""con"" lists very useful when trying to find specific details so that is how I am going to handle this.Pros:-SIM Card Worked Immediately: I have had MANY phones I had to change APN settings before data would work, including really expensive ones. Studio 7.0 ii had no problems and I didn't have to mess with any settings.-Speaker: Some other reviewers have listed this as a con but I thought it sounded just fine for a cheap phone. It isn't extremely loud nor is extremely clear, but it does it job when listing to podcasts in bed or playing a quick game. If my environment is loud, I use headphones.-Bluetooth And WIFI Worked Great: I used bluetooth headphones and my home WIFI without fail.-Played Games Surprisingly Well: I immediately downloaded Minecraft as a test. While it took awhile to loud, it ran rather smooth. I see this on a lot of newer low end phones. They take awhile to load more demanding games but do surprisingly well once it is complete.-Appearance: It looks like a very nice device. Back mimics the original Nexus 7 but looks more elegant with the metal trim. The front gives off an HTC M7/M8/M9 vibe.-Weight: It felt light in my hands for its overall size. Sure it is my heaviest phone, but it is 7 inches!Cons:-Battery: Simply bad. There really isn’t any other way to describe it. With no games, phone calls and minimal video, I can’t imagine the Studio 7 ii ever lasting a full day.-USB Port: Most USB ports on phones have a ""click"" when the cord is inserted. Not only doesn't this phone have the same sound or sensation, but different cords have all fallen out of this phone with very minimal pull. It became hard to use and charge at the same time.-Screen Sensitivity: Too many times did I have to touch the screen twice before it registered what I was trying to do.-No Proximity Sensor: So this partly my fault for not noticing the omission prior to purchase. I didn’t realize how much I would miss it until my face started an internet radio station while talking on the phone. This really should be on EVERY phone.-Video Streaming Issues: In multiple apps, I had issues streaming video. During the first minute, I would get an error message. Once the video restarted, I would have no problems. This happened consistently.-Minimal Screen Brightness Adjustments: As someone who uses their phone in bed quite a bit, I often change brightness levels. Difference between the highest and lowest settings in laughable at best.-Sim Card/SD Card Slot: Using a screw might sound like a good idea considering everyone owns screwdrivers. Big problem? The screw is so tiny that it becomes incredibly easy to misplace it. As someone who changes phones all the time, I am worried it will drop in the couch or something like that. They should have just used a typical slot.-Microphone During Call: I have made exactly one phone call so far with this phone, and I made it expressly to test how using a 7in phone would work out. Straight from the beginning, the person on the other side had troubles hearing me. I had to press the phone against my face for the sound to be loud enough on the other end.-Camera: I hate to list this as a con since I knew neither would be good, but they terrible. They are probably worse than the $50 Windows Phones I have used in the last couple years. Grainy is the norm and unfortunately it stands out more on the low-res screen.-SD Card Support: Honestly this could just be my unit, but my card became corrupt within one day of putting it into this phone. The card has been fine in multiple other devices so I know it isn't the card.-Power Button Response: If I haven't touched my phone in 20 minutes or more, the screen won't come on for a SOLID 5 seconds. Obviously this is unacceptable, even for a phone in this price range.-Android Not Up To Date: I do not give any phone maker wiggle room on this. I am a firm believer that EVERY phone should get updates for 2 years from original release date. Considering this device hasn't been updated since release (as far as I can tell), Blu needs to get their act together. Stagefright exploit needs to be patched.Neutral:-Screen: It is exactly what I thought it would be: a low resolution 7 inch screen that does the job.-General Speed: Going in-between apps isn’t speedy but certainly is good enough, esp. for those used to lower end devices.-USB Port Location: I much prefer it on the bottom but understand that this is different for everyone.So here is the real question: Do I plan on keeping this phone and would I recommend it to anyone? Simply no. My experience with talking on the phone made me quickly realize this is simply a tablet with a single, low end mic at the bottom of the device. Blu didn’t put any thought into making the usability of such a large device easier for the user. Given the phone issues, USB port issues and the SD card issues, I couldn’t possibly suggest anyone buy this. It makes a below average tablet and an horrible phone.",13.0

Nokia 5230 Quad-band GSM Cell Phone - Unlocked,Nokia,189.0,2,"Nokia had many GREAT phones in the past but this one is just POOR. I had many Nokia phones before and they all had great usability. The Nokia 5230 Nuron, however, makes me very disappointed. I *rarely* refer to user's manual for electronic gadgets but this one got me. I work as a User Interface Designer and I consider myself pretty techie. I struggled a lot when I use the phone. Thought maybe it was my problem. No. Gave it to another coworker to test it and he also got stuck on entering the most basic: Contacts.1. I spent 30 minutes trying to figure out how to use QWERTY to enter my contacts. I had the Alphanumeric keypad up and I tried to find how to turn the QWERTY on. Click on the icon that looks like a keyboard. And they trick you! A dropdown comes up and it only has 'Handwriting' and 'Alphanumeric keypad' on it. No QWERTY. I tried turning the phone horizontally. Nothing changed. Little did I know I had to turn the phone ""anti-clockwise"" to trigger the QWERTY keyboard to come up. If you turn it the other way it won't work. Fine! Now I learned. But that keyboard icon just totally got me. If a keyboard can't be turned on from there, then don't make the icon looks like a keyboard for goodness sake!2. The MAP interaction is unintuitive. I have the phone for 2 days already and I'm still trying to figure out how to use it properly. First of all, who would use a SmartPhone MAP for the sake of looking at it these days? Its main purpose should be for user to ""get directions"" to a place! Not for the Nuron. I open the MAP and I don't know what to do. I see an ""Options"" button. I click on it and was hoping to see a ""Go to place"" link. No. Instead I see a bunch of useless links. The MOST important link isn't there. Then there's a ""Search"" button. EVERYTIME I click on it, I keep forgetting that I have to ERASE everything I typed in before in order to enter new entry. OH and to make it worse, you have to repeat that for 3 total fields (ZIP code, Street Name, Street Number!) (Why not combine Street Number and Street Name????) Then you have to click 'Options' again to hit 'Search'. Then it tells you how many miles afar... (I didn't know that the number of miles is THAT important. It's the first thing I need to know? I DON'T CARE!!!) THEN you click that Address again (took me awhile to figure that out) to hit 'Drive to'. Took me 30 minutes to find that out.3. EVERY time after I put in the battery and switch it on, it resets the Date/Time/Country. You have to reenter EVERYTHING again. Shouldn't a SmartPhone be able to detect where you are and the timezone??Many more but I don't want to go into it.Bottom line, with this kind of price ($165)? Go for the iPhone.",7.0

Just lacking in some of the critical aspects that I purchased the phone based on. The camera might be 13mp, but the pictures are constantly out of focus and of poor quality. I've tried every mode possible and still the pics are poor. The battery life isn't as good I might expect. It is good for about 3/4 day, but I still have to charge. It does charge very rapidly. My main complaint is that the phone compresses images for sending texts. My photos look really strange when I send them. I also have trouble with various apps.",

Everything I would need came along with the phone and everything is WHITE, wouldn't you be different from the crowd. The screen is very sensitive and I guess it will take some time for me to get a hold of this vast phone - the apps preloaded and so much more out there are off the hook, camera 20 stars.Downside- the battery cover was disappointing, I wouldn't mind if they sent me a 'free smooth white cover' instead of the current one with lines. The screen has a little shake it it hopefully nothing serious- you wouldn't notice it when you r in the heat of pushing up and typing.The price was good that's why I chose this company and the other reviews helped.

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,5,"I purchased this phone for a couple of months and to be honest is my first experience with smartphones, because it has taken me several days to get familiar with its operation, and I went from having a regular phone to this incredibly functional gadget and change has been a noticeable leap, its 800 mHz processor is quite fast and efficient. The touch screen is very good quality, sensible, scratch resistent (gorilla glass), decent amazing definition and brightness. It's camera takes pictures of acceptable quality, and the video runs smoothly. The size of the phone without being small makes it suitable for carrying in your pocket without a problem, or the discomfort of smartphones largest and highest range and price.Android as operattivo system is very friendly and intuitive, easy to use and I love power because all you can do with a phone and more!Works great with the 3G network from my country (Costa Rica). Simply insert the SIM and voila, a few minutes I was conected and running properly, I did not think it would be so simple to be honest!The only negative thing I could say so far is the short battery life when using multiple functions simultaneously (common problem with smartphones) as already mentioned in other grades here ... But this is easily solved with an extra charger in the office and at home, and upload daily ... jeje!At last I can recommend this phone without fear for those who like me (not being a fan for the latest in technology) nedd the benefits of a smartphone that have a good average performance, but with several extra applications that allow you to grow and evolve according to your needs as a user ... By the way I wrote this review from my phone, which I think is really amazing!Adquirí este telefono desde hace un par de meses y para ser sincero es mi primer experiencia con smartphones, debido a esto me ha tomado varios dias para familiarizarme con su funcionamiento, ya que pasé de tener un telefono regular a este increiblemente funcional aparatito y el cambio ha sido un salto cualitativo notorio, su procesador de 800 mhz es bastante rapido y eficiente. La pantalla tactil es de muy buena calidad, sensible, resistente a rayones (gorilla glass), con decente definicion y brillos asombrosos. Su camara toma fotos de una calidad aceptable, y el video corre muy bien. El tamaño del telefono sin ser pequeño, lo hace adecuado para llevarlo en el bolsillo sin mayor problema, ni la incomodidad de smartphones mas grandes y de mayor rango y precio.Android como sistema operattivo es muy amigable e intuitivo, facil de usar y me encanta ya que potencia todo lo que puedes hacer con un telefono y mas!Funciona muy bien con la red 3G de mi pais (Costa Rica). Simplemente insertar el SIM y listo, a los pocos minutos ya estaba enlazado y funcionando adecudamente, no crei que seria tan sencillo para ser honestos!La unica cosa negativa que podria decir hasta ahora es la corta duracion de la bateria al usar varias funciones simultaneamente (problema comun con los smartphones) como ya lo han mencionado en otras calificaciones aqui... Pero esto es facilmente solucionable con un cargador extra en la oficina y otro en casa, y cargarlo diariamente... jeje!En fin puedo recomendar sin temores a este telefono para aquellos que como yo (sin ser un fanatico por lo ultimo en tecnolgia) ocupamos los beneficios de un buen smartphone de desempeño medio, pero con varias aplicaciones extra que te permitan crecer segun tus necesidades y evolucionar como usuario... Por cierto he escrito esta critica desde mi telefono; lo cual me parece asombroso!!!",197.0

LG Neon GT365 Prepaid GoPhone (AT&T),LG,69.99,1,"My sister and I both bought ours about the same time and from the very beginning had issues, although they started minor. First thing I do when I get a new phone- I call someone I know and ask them how I sounded. This phone failed that test, as the other person said I sounded very scratchy and about to lose a signal- I was having strong signals, so I know it wasn't the issue. This never changed.Later on, I found out that my phone somehow unlocked itself and went online. It wasted about $10 of my airtime. I called Support over it and the guy was an absolute sweetheart with me, but couldnt do anything to help me except suggest I get a different phone.I had the phone for less than 6 months and never was much happy about it. Quality of the phone and software was terrible.If you want to save some money (which most gophone users are), then skip this phone and get another one. This is one of AT&T's first smartphones, which will use more of your money when you do go online and such (which is why they push the unlimited package on you as soon as you get the phone).

Mix Walkman WT13I Blk with green,Sony Ericsson,40.0,1,"I received this phone yesterday & I was so excited! I was looking for a phone that could be my MP3 player, too (less to cart around), and this looked like it would fit the bill. I opened it up & got to putting it together, and was aggravated first thing. And it just kept getting worse.1--The instructions don't include how to get the back cover off without scratching it or, like me, breaking a nail. If I weren't an experienced cell user, I'd have never figured it out.2--Even in silent mode, it makes sounds!3--The menus, and lack thereof, suck horribly. There is no menu key or icon, and things you would normally expect to have a menu don't...like your text message inbox.4--Speaking of text messages, how's this for abso nuts: YOU CAN'T DELETE THEM! No, I'm not kidding. I even tried downloading the PDF version of the user manual, thinking there would be better, more complete instructions there. No frickin' luck. The only way I found to delete them was to format & re-install the cell OS. The lack of a way to delete them would be OK if you could move them onto the external SD card & delete them from there, but you can't. And the phone only has 116MB of user available space. Once that is full, you have to format & redo everything!5--The user manual is a joke.6--The UI is not U friendly.7--If you want to remove the SIM card and keep the phone for an MP3 player, good luck. The only thing you can do without the SIM card inserted is make an emergency call.There were 2 things I liked about it: 1--The MP3 player sounds as good as my Walkman MP3 player; 2--The alarm is nice.I know some of y'all are thinking, ""Come on, girl! What'd you expect for under $100?!"" I tell you what I didn't expect...I didn't expect the $15 emergency ""someone lost mine"" phone I got for my brother from Wal-Mart to be a better deal. For about $20 more than the $73 I spent on this, I could have gotten a Palm Pixie Plus and been much happier. I just would have been limited to 7G of user available space. Which is probably what I'll do when I return this one today.UPDATE: I found out how to delete a text! Not from the instructions, but from playing with it. You double tap the text message. It's still going back.",0.0

When I woke up, I noticed it was glitching very badly between my PIN lock screen and the home screen dashboard. My touches did not register. I couldn't even make it go into a hard reset.Fast forward one hour later -- it had stopped holding a charge. The phone died pretty hard and at a time I was least expecting it.Fast forward some more -- I attempt to RMA the phone. Their website isn't very intuitive when it comes to finding a repair center. Eventually I find their US repair center. I start filling out the forms, but then I realized I couldn't grab my phone's IMEI and chalked it up as a $175+ loss. Fortunately I have the budget to grab a new phone, but that's still a lot of money to spend on a phone just to have it stop working after a month of moderate use.It's a shame, because for the price, it's a snappy little phone. I liked their UI, and it was fairly close to stock Android. Way better than anything with Touchwiz shoved on it, that's for sure. The camera wasn't that great, but I was willing to live with that. I may grab another one just because I liked the UI so much, but I am going to be very weary and much more proactive about keeping the proper warranty info.Maybe it would just be worth getting a Moto G instead.",1.0

"LG G2 D801 Unlocked Cellphone, 32GB, Black",LG,274.0,2,"Phone arrived on time, and as a lot of the reviews stated, was in an unsealed box so I'd say phone is new as stated, but not brand new since seal was broken, but it had the stickers/plastic on phone so for the price you can't beat it, so no complaints there. Phone works great now, after 3-4 updates to the Android OS, the original software was pretty rough, texting keyboard and navigation buttons were too close so typing was a pain, phone kept closing windows, opening menu's and pushing wrong buttons which was frustrating. After update though, a pop up tutorial asked me to change settings, so I made buttons bigger, and rearranged the navigation buttons a little and fixed that problem, so it's perfect now. Besides the minor setback for a day or 2 I'd say I love this phone so far, battery is much better then the Samsung S3 I had before this, processor seems faster, new Android software it much better, and adjustment setting for anything and everything which is great. The only other issue I've noticed is you have to try not to get any drops of water on the screen, especially cold water, it will mess up the touch screen for a few minutes, so it's not as durable as the Samsungs.Update 12/12/15I wouldn't buy this phone, Its been less then a year, maybe 6 months and it's basically dead already. Screen cracked from it just being in my pocket after about a month, not dropped or anything (And I'm very careful with my electronics and had a case on it). Now screens not working, 3 months later, have to tap keyboard several times to make work, words don't show when texting, freezing on messaging. It's been eceiving/sending multiple messages when only 1 was sent, since I got it. And after using camera a while realized it's not that great which is the least of my worries. So NOW I'd say unless you only need a temporary phone for a few months don't buy this. This is the 3rd LG phone I've tried. They are always broken almost out of the box brand new. So never again will I try them. They have poor manufacturing quality, which is a shame because I like the style and looks of their phones. I Now regret buying this and could have spend 50$ more for an S4 that would last longer. Now I need to blow 300$ on a new phone already.",1.0

Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge G9350 32GB HK DUAL SIM Factory Unlocked GSM International Version no warranty (BLUE CORAL),Samsung,616.99,4,"I am coming from Note 3. Tried and returned the following phones:Nexus 6 – very poor battery life for massive screen, but overall quite good;Nexus 6P – very bad sound quality (low volume, very low volume), build quality (headphone jack broke in 10 days)I did not want to go with Samsung just for the fact that they do not stand behind their products and make their products obsolete and not supported after 2 years. Not acceptable for me, and my Note 3 still works great even though it is running in KitKat.But anyway, I was getting tired finding a good Android phone. By that time every manufacture has to produce a great phone, which has great OIS camera, good CPU, bright screen and be nice looking with strong materials. But looks like every manufacture is failing to do that. Some have good screens, bad build quality, some just bad battery, or bad internals. I see only Samsung is making something decent I can live with: Great design, strong body, good and stable software and have ability to root.So after multiple tries with others, I decided to go back to Samsung.Let me start with things I do not like about it.1. Edge screen is too sensitive and I think there should be an option to disable edge touch, or make it app specific. Forget about quality typing with one hand. You will always hit backspace or other keys on your right (if you are right-handed) with your palm. Waiting for a case to see if this going to help. This is huge -1 star for this device);2. Home button is still sticking out of the body. Why not to flash it so there are no accidental wake ups while in the pocket or somewhere else?3. Fingerprint is not good. Nexus 6P had the best and was fastest. Here it fails to recognize in a lot of occasions even while trying to set it up. BTW, why only 4 fingerprints can be setup. Why not more? I was setting up the same finger touching with different sides of the finger in case I need to unlock from different angles.Now what I like:1. Screen brightness – great. The best among all the phones on the market;2. Sound quality (music) over headphones and Bluetooth. BUT. Sound quality is not that good using original signal processing. I am very peaky for bass and treble. That is why I was looking for a phone, I can root and install Viper4Android to make phone sound perfect.3. Like headjack on the bottom, now you can slip you phone in the pocket without flipping it over to make headjack on the top while it is in your pocket.4. Completely unlocked phone vs Snapdragon model where bootloader is locked. I installed Custom Recovery, rooted phone, installed Wanam Xposed framework and Viper4Android. These pieces of software is a must for me. Wanam provided me with long press back button to kill process, long press volume keys to switch tracks, remove annoying popup when headset volume is high and some other features. And Viper4Android makes sound like no one else can produce.5. Always On Screen – love it. Does not look like it drains a lot of battery if at all;6. Build quality – gorgeous. Back does not feel glass though. But I am going to put case on it anyway.7. Battery – very easy to make though the day or two. Used it with Navigation and screen ON for 2 hour drive. Battery went down only 15%.8. Taking pictures – very good and I like the fact that it is wide angle. Both front and back camera took very good pictures even indoors, while at the dance competition. Focus is lightning fast.9. Connectivity – very strong and where my Note 3 or Nexus 6P were struggling for LTE signal (AT&T), Galaxy S7 was fine.10. Call quality – it feels like a person is just next to you. Very clear and solid.11. Glad that Samsung did not remove the option to scale screen. Unfortunately they only provide 2 options: Standard and Condensed, but at least something. Nexus 6P gave me more options from 400 dpi to 640 dpi. But I had Cyanogenmod running on Nexus 6P.12. Performance – very fast, no lags at all.13. Google Pay is working on it even I am rooted and have Wanam installed. Made first payment today and it was good.Overall looks like it is a keeper, but if edge screen sensitivity is not fixed, I will exchange that phone to Note 6 in the near future. (Hope they will not make it with curved edge – I hate it).",2.0

Each LG i believe beats out the other phones in its manufacturing year. the internet speed is one of the best video quality is good, and productivity apps are great. speakers are very good, but not great. light weight but very durable. this phone is near perfect especially whe n you consider the price point. it absolutely blows my mind this isn't apples direct competitor. i would take this over any Samsung, and over any apple products although i get the people who like iphones. absolutely recommend this phone to anyone looking for a good android, oh by the way did i mention, battery is removable and micro sd slot is available. phones a perfect 10 for me",0.0

"Palm Pre 2 16GB Verizon CDMA Phone with webOS 2.0, Touchscreen, Full QWERTY Keyboard, 5MP Camera, GPS and Wi-Fi - Black",Palm,99.99,1,"I love the look of this phone. It's compact, attractive, stylist. The swipe features are also really nice and I've found this phone to be relatively easy to use. My Google contacts synced right up and within minutes the phone was ready to go. Tomorrow it's going back to Amazon.Here's why:-The phone runs hot. And not just a little warm, or a lot warm, it's hot. So hot it was uncomfortable and I tried to hold the phone by its sides when I used it.-When charging, the phone got even hotter. I'm not joking when I'm saying it burned my hand. I'm wondering, now that the phone is packed and ready to go back, if my unit was defective. Because if a lot of people experienced this, they're either ignoring it or they don't know how unusual it is for a phone to get that hot.-My Yahoo! mail wouldn't sync. I kept getting an error. I deleted the account and set it back up 4 times.-The battery life is terrible. The first day it lasted almost 6 hours and I hooked it up for an hour, after which it lasted for another hour.-The second day the battery lasted 5 hours. I was barely on it as I was busy and every time I checked the screen, my battery had dwindled another 15-20%. So when it got to 55%, I set it on my desk and walked away from it. Two hours later it was dead to world, in the middle of the afternoon.I'm coming from an iPhone (due to mine being water damaged). This seemed like a suitable replacement until I could afford to replace my iPhone. But after using an iPhone which lasts all day and doesn't get warm to the touch, this Palm Pre 2 was unacceptable.I liked the software, but the hardware has some serious issues. I wanted to give it two stars because I really liked the design of it, but two stars meant that I simply didn't like the phone. And I hated it.",9.0

Nokia Lumia 930 International Version No Warranty Unlocked Black,,208.0,5,"This phone is by far the best phone I have ever had the chance to own. The only thing that lacks is the App selection which doesn't really matter to me because all of the main apps are available such as YouTube, Netflix, IGN, Hulu, etc.This is one solid phone, it feels like a lot of effort was put into the build quality. I really love the beveled glass on the screen. It makes the phone look and feel better than other phones.The Nokia Lumia 930 gets great reception as well. It was pretty easy to see how much better it is because my fiance gets dropped calls consistently in certain spots in town (I did with my old phone too). These dropped calls seem as reliable as gravity in those spots. My Lumia 930 very rarely gets dropped calls in those locations! The call quality is great too, it is easy to hear on both ends of the spectrum (you and who ever you call).Internet browsing is amazingly crisp and smooth. It works even better than my Samsung Tablet 2 10.1 inch! Searching for something on the web is as easy as tapping the search button on the bottom right corner of the phone or by asking Cortana.You can easily stream music and videos in 1080p. I can certainly tell the picture quality is way better than previous/current phones. The camera is 20 megapixels, so the pictures look astounding. Not only that, but this camera has a wide array of selections for how to take the picture. The video is surprisingly good quality too, especially considering that there are 4 microphones placed all over the phone so you can get a surround sound effect to your videos. You will be pleasantly surprised by how loud the speakers are on this thing. They are louder than my laptop speakers, and have great sound quality too. Games and apps run really smooth on this phone due to its powerful quad -core snapdragon processor and 2GB of ram! This phone is beast! Another nice thing about this phone is how it connects to your computer. Looking through the files is easier than other phones. Windows even has a free security management site where you can send a signal to your phone to share its location via GPS if it ever gets lost or stolen!I thoroughly tested this ""find my phone"" service and I must say, I am impressed. You can ring your phone (even overrides silent mode), find it via GPS, lock your phone, and even erase your phone from your home computer. All of which is a free service and really does work. The user interface is incredibly easy to use and looks great. Keep in mind that if you have never owned a windows phone, it will be a little confusing until you get use to it. Once you do, it will be hard to switch back to anything else.I use this phone to do everything. Pictures, email, notes, navigation (Nokia had the best free navigation app in my opinion called here drive+), and more. Text input is smooth and easy. The spell check works great too. The phone memorizes how you structure sentences allowing you to select words above the keys instead of typing them out. I can type full texts sometimes this way in a matter of seconds.As I said before, the display on this phone is outstanding with 1080p resolution. Its plenty bright and is surprisingly easy to see even outside.The standby time lasts a very long time. The longest I have seen this phone last with minor use, no Wi-Fi on, was 26 hours with about 20% battery life left. I briefly browsed the web a few times, texted regularly, and made a call or two. Another thing that I love about the battery is that you can charge it with a wireless charge dock! It comes set up to do that unlike some phones that require you to buy other accessories to make it work.Cortana is the best phone AI ever, multiple reviews of AI systems agree. It is so easy to search, schedule, navigate, etc. with Cortana.Overall, this phone works amazingly well and I highly recommend it. I got the unlocked version from Amazon for less than an iPhone 6 by $500 or more. I personally think it out performs the iPhone too. On paper, it far out performs the IPhone 6 too. It is less restrictive and has a much better build quality to it. When you compare the specs, it's hard to see why people spend 2-3 times as much money for less power. Even the IPhone 6+ isn't as powerful. Here are the specs between the IPhone 6 and the Nokia Lumia 930:IPhone 6:Resolution: 750 x 1334 (IPhone 6 + 1080 x 1920)Camera: 8MPProcessor: Dual core, 1400 MHz, 64-bitRAM: 1024Battery Standby: 10.4 days (IPhone 6+ 16 days)Battery Capacity: 1810 mAh (IPhone 6+ 2915 mAh)Wireless Charging: NoPrice (Amazon 12/12/14):$768 - $1070 (16GB vs 128GB) up to $1275 for the 128GB IPhone 6+Nokia Lumia 930:Resolution: 1080 x 1920Camera: 20MPProcessor: Quad core, 2200 MHz, KraitRAM: 2048GBBattery Standby: 23 daysBattery Capacity: 2420 mAhWireless Charging: Built-InPrice (Amazon 12/12/14): $439.99 (http://www.phonearena.com/phones/compare/Nokia-Lumia-930,Apple-iPhone-6,Apple-iPhone-6-Plus/phones/8571,8346,8908)I currently use mine for T-Mobile, but many sources say it works with the majority of phone companies (unlocked international version).",7.0

LG A275 Black Unlocked GSM Dual SIM QuadBand Cell Phone - International Version - No Warranty,LG,50.5,2,"It's exactly what I was looking for: a small, super-simple phone to use for international travel as well as for an extra local phone for the family. The dual SIM card feature is a nice bonus for foreign travel. I love the fact that it has almost no features... as long as I can throw a SIM card in it and make a call, that's all I want.Problem is, it didn't even work as a basic phone. I could send and receive calls, but it arrived new in the box with a speaker which was completely dead. It would vibrate, but not ring. I couldn't hear anything from the person at the other end, but they could hear me. I downloaded and read the manual, and went through all of the volume settings, but no luck.Since I couldn't actually hear anything, I can't report on sound quality, but from a test call, I was told that my voice came through clearly on the other end as long as I spoke directly into the mouthpiece. But it's a tiny little phone, and if I held it up to my ear, the person on the other end couldn't clearly hear me, and said my voice kept dropping out. Since the mouthpiece only came down to my cheek, I think holding a real conversation might be difficult.No problem getting a cell signal, or sending/receiving calls, using an AT&T SIM card from my home (where we have a strong signal).There's a built-in FM radio, which also didn't work. When I plugged in headphones, I could hear the FM static just fine, but no stations. I don't really care about getting radio from a phone, but when it doesn't pick up any signals near a major city... that's a problem.I really wish this little phone worked, and I still may try again, but I'm not optimistic.",2.0

Blu is the kind phone over there you never loose connection no matter how far you go. He just lost his olf blu and was very upset about it and I decided to get one from here, this same model is around a thousand reais in Brazil (lot money for them) so for $124, sold!I was impressed with the screen size and how nice the phone looks but got yo admit I got very upset checking the phone. I wasn't expecting a perfect phone but I definitely was expecting more! The front camera got this flash what helps a lot while taking pictures and if you freeze you kind can get a decent one. The front camera is awful, the focus takes forever and you have to wait about 2 seconds before you ""click"" the picture otherwise you will mess the image up! The video Oooh boy! Is decent if you stay and dont move around, if you do move no matter how slow, it will loose completly its focus, so trying to recording something in movement FORGET ABoUT IT. After also recording it, even thought the environment was quiet (I was inside the bedroom) there are too much noise in all videos I made, like it was winding '. And last of all, the volume! OMG it is really bad, no matter how high a video are the audio SUCKS!! I downloaded a volume boosting app called mobileuncle tools and still nothin =/ ! With headphones is a little bit better but not perfect, there a little noises! I know the phone was only a $124 but I've had other phones for about same price from Lg and Samsung and they were just great! I really wanted it to be good! At least I saved my dad R$ 1000. Definitely not worth it!Oohh the online videos images are alright though, and the battery really seems to be good, is been on low all night long since yesterday afternoon and still the same!

Sometimes, I play youtube videos on it connecting it to wi-fi at home. Screen is sharp and speakers are great.6) Camera is average, videos recording it very good (resolution is not very high but in small size, its quite clean).Cons: Battery life could have been great.We purchased it more than 6 months back.

BLU Studio C 5+5 Smartphone with Lollipop OS- US GSM Unlocked - Gold,BLU,249.99,4,"I picked up this BLU Studio C 5+5 LTE after using a variety of Samsung low-midrange phones. My wife really liked the size and performance of my Galaxy Grand Prime, so I decided to pass it to her and picked this up for my use. The specs are very similar, so I thought it would be worth trying for less than $90! After almost 3 months, it has proven to be a worthy investment.There are a couple of things that are making me want to upgrade (...to another BLU model). I would like a larger battery, the Samsung has a 2400mah vs 2000mah on this. There seems to be less memory available after Lollipop loaded than on the Samsung. I have noticed that the screen is a little more finicky to touch, but that seems to be mostly when my hands are cold.I am considering moving to a phone with 16g/2g memory( Life XL or Life One X) and putting this on the shelf as a backup. I would not hesitate to purchase another BLU product.",0.0

Both cameras take fairly decent photos, but, for some reason the 5mp camera seemed to take higher resolution photos than the 13mp camera. The 13mp camera photos seemed a little dark and it had a difficult time focusing on an object. I installed a few games and all of them ran without stuttering. I was able to watch Youtube videos in 1080p without a hiccup over wifi, and I was able to transfer files over bluetooth, without a problem. The screen quality was OK, for the price of the phone. The included silicon case feels nice in the hand and the phone is just the right size for a man with large hands like myself.Where the phone started to fall short is the audio. I could barely hear any sound through the speakers and when I went to hook up an external speaker, nothing happened, no audio came out of the jack. I then tried a second speaker, same problem, I could not get an external speaker to work with the phone. Maybe a bluetooth speaker would work, but, I don't have one laying around to test it. I could hear some tinny noise through the included headphones, but, it is horrible and grated on my nerves.The final straw for the phone, was when I charged it and I went to unplug the wall wart from the wall. It was so hot I dropped it and my fingers were red. I then felt the back of the phone and it was also hot to the touch, even through the silicon case. I have already initiated a return and will be sending it back.I have never owned another BLU phone before, and I will be hard pressed to get another BLU phone in the near future.",0.0

Nokia Lumia 920 RM-821 32GB Black Windows 8 Smartphone 4G LTE (GSM Factory Unlocked),Nokia,79.95,2,The hardware is great but the software sucks. I have been using Nokia products over seven years now and my current phone is a Nokia E7 running Symbian Belle which makes the Windows Operating system (OS) look like trash. The OS is so simplified that there is no granularity and it is easy to see why Microsoft will go nowhere with any phone with their OS. It is a pity that Nokia abandoned Symbian in favour of this waste-of-time OS causing me to seriously shift my allegiance to a Jolla phone later on.When I first turned on the phone I was instantly challenged by the language (Norwegian?) which of course was not English so I had to really try to figure out how to go ahead. Eventually I got to a part where English could have been chosen and the rest of the setup was easy from there. To add insult to injury the manual supplied was not in English but luckily I was able to download one that was in English.The camera is a very good camera and the bottom line for me is that as long as my wife likes it then I am happy but I will NEVER buy a phone like this for myself.,0.0

"Nokia C6 Unlocked GSM Phone with Easy E-mail Setup, Side-Sliding Touchscreen, QWERTY, 5 MP Camera, and Free Ovi Maps Navigation (Black)",Nokia,59.95,3,"04/05/2012 UPDATE: I want to do a quick comparison between the Nokia C6-00 and Android phones, specifically Samsung Nexus S by Google. I've been using the Google android phone for the past 11 months and it did EVERYTHING I needed it to do from paying for Starbucks coffee using a Starbucks app so I didn't need to carry my Starbucks card around and accessing multiple MS Exchange accounts to the interface and OS being slick and nimble as well as Google directions/mapping/GPS; the MAJOR downside to smartphones such as Android and others is the fact that they are battery drainers because of the intense use of power for the OS and display especially. I could not last more than 6-8 hours on Android and this is with setting the Display to the lowest brightness at all times which is a pain when outdoors in bright sunlight. That was the ONLY issue with my Android. Anyway, it did everything I needed so I stuck with it. Until recently the sounds stopped working. So I sold it and now I am back with Nokia. The strength of Nokia is the battery lasts a good 14-15 hours on standby (not sure why this Amazon description states 16 days or so, no, 15 hours, so at the end of the day before going to bed, you need to charge it up again for the next day). I can only add ONE MS Exchange email account on Nokia and I also have Gmail installed. The OS is not as slick and fast as Android and there is a ""white screen"" lag, but you put up with it. The sounds, ringing, call quality and reliability of the Nokia as a PHONE first and foremost is second to none. The Android (Samsung) had low ringing volume even at maximum. Also Sprint service for the Android was weak in my area, so ATT under Nokia was better. The Nokia is a ""workhorse"" of a phone that is loud (volume, I like!) and does a barely ok job at being a 'smart phone.' I will keep using it for now because of long battery life and I can switch out the SIM card to my flip phone using the same data plan for traveling using a small flip phone, esp. overseas like Europe (ATT only charges $10 month for unlimited data since it is not considered a smart phone versus minimum $30 for smart phone). Will I eventually switch to a smart phone when something I like comes out, YES, of course, the Android experience (except for battery life) did EVERYTHING I needed a smartphone to do (rich apps for banking, Starbucks, etc) and my LIFESTYLE. What will I look for in a smart phone next time? STRONG BATTERY LIFE (EASILY LASTING 15 HOURS ON STANDBY OR BASICALLY WHAT I CALL A 'WHOLE DAY' BEFORE CHARGING AT NIGHT), LOUD RINGER AND VOLUME, 4G CAPABILITY, HANDLE MULTIPLE MS EXCHANGE EMAIL ACCOUNTS.06/20/2011 UPDATE: Bought this phone in September 2010. There is still a slight lag (in the form of a ""white screen"") in between applications but other than this and the slight heft (weight) to the phone, it is a good sized pull out keyboard phone. For a while the Ovi maps and Ovi store apps did not work, I finally figured out I needed to delete the old files from apps manager and redownload Ovi maps and Ovi store. The trick is it is a Catch 22, you cannot download Ovi maps with Ovi store (the PC sync did not work for me in the first place), and you cannot if Ovi store did not work, I finally went to the browser and searched download ovi store and did it that way and once I go Ovi store working, downloaded Ovi maps and then everything works now. The music was a trick, you need to sync to your PC and copy and paste to the C6 after created a ""Music"" folder, then in the C6 press music and then library and then ""Options"" and then refresh the list and then your copied and pasted music will show up, otherwise you will be figuring out why it does not show up after a while, you need to manually refresh the music library!I added somore more apps like a flashlight and games, etc. It is 100% working and a nice little phone. However, my main phone is a Samsung Nexus S 4G from Sprint because it is a PURE GOOGLE experience on android, it is faster and smoother, and because I rely on gmail and Google calendar and Google everything apps, it just works for me. This C6 is a travel phone for me, for example I also have a Motorola Ming A1200 flip phone I used in Europe and the C6 will also be a travel phone for me when I do not need to take my larger Nexus S 4G with me traveling. So the C6 is powered off, all set up, and stored away in my closet until my next travel trip (the last time I took it I went to Idaho and Oregon on business) because the battery life on the C6 lasts a whole day+, the flip phone Ming A1200 was even better, a few days battery. The Nexus S 4G I charge every night and can't beat the apps and user experience on nexus S.Recommendation is 3 stars now from 2 stars. I would recommended it but would advise of the heft and the white screen. Everything works on it though, but with MS Exchange you can only add one email address so I have a MS Exchange address and a Gmail address, which is basically what I need for email.11/1/2010 UPDATE: HAD THIS PHONE FOR A FEW WEEKS NOW, THE ""WHITE SCREEN"" BETWEEN SWITCHING SCREENS, ETC IS GETTING ANNOYING NOW, FOR $300+ OR SO I PAID FOR THIS PHONE I EXPECT A FASTER PROCESSOR. I AM CHANGING MY STARS FROM 4 TO 2; I WOULD NOT BUY THIS IF I KNEW HOW ANNOYINGLY THIS WHITE SCREEN WOULD BE.I am reviewing Nokia C6 here first since I had time to play with it, I will review the N900 soon in a bit under the N900 product site on Amazon (I reviewed the N900 on 10/13/10 so look for it under my ""Kingmonkey"" ID). The C6 . . . I couldn't decide between Nokia N900 and C6 (did not want new N8 coming out end of September 2010 since there was no physical keyboard), so I bought both N900 and C6. Phones do not come with a case to hold, which is a disappointment considering how much each phone costs. For some reason Nokia only sells OEM cases for these phones to the European market, if you go to Amazon UK site or Nokia EU site you will see cases made for N900 and C6, so I had to go to Amazon UK site to order an OEM case for N900; the C6 on Nokia EU site has some nice ones but could not find them on Amazon UK and on Nokia EU site I cannot order them online being from the USA as you need to go to a retail location in Europe. Anyway got some generic case (more like a pouch) for the C6 from Amazon UK.The C6 is a nice looking, stylish phone, good size phone, not too thick or long at all, it's fairly small and fits in your shirt pocket if you are a guy. Made of quality materials and feels like a quality product from the weight of the phone and also when you slide the keyboard out, it is stiff and not moving about. The top row keyboard key is a little close to the top half of the phone so when you type your thumb hits the top and gets in the way; not a deal breaker for me as I just learn to adapt. Those with bigger hands (fingers) may find the keyboard a little cramped but I wanted a smaller smart phone compared to the other ones out there such as Samsung Galaxy or Motorola Droid, so it is expected to be smaller overall as that is part of the appeal. Physically that was the only issue, again, Nokia is stylish, smart looking, and as always, love their Nokia ringtone theme. One last thing on the physical side, being a middle of the road phone (between N8 and lower end Nokia phones) it doe snot have al of the bells and whistles hence the lower price. One feature I wish it had, like the more higher end N900, is a camera lens cover, the camera is just exposed to dust, etc; the C6 does come with a factory ""screen protector"" and since this is a new phone and you can't buy a screen protector just yet I suggest leaving it on to protect the screen, since after I set up the C6, the screen protector is scratched from my use of the phone (normal use with fingers swiping back and forth, mind you, I take care of my nice things, gently putting it down, wrapping it in napkin until my pouch comes in the mail, wash my hands and dry them, no lotion, before I handled my phone), so even with all of this the screen still gets scratched slightly if you look at it at an angle. Anyway will need to buy a screen protector when they are available and hopefully the one that came with it will last.On the software side, the 2GB microsd chip only holds the California map and voice navigation (street names + male voice both for US as two separate files); that's about 2GB total. If you want all of US and other countries, need to buy a 16GB microsd but even with this not sure if it can hold all the maps as you will need to delete some still as some maps are several gigs(I think 16GB additional gigs is the limit the C6 can handle for a microsd card). I don't travel a lot outside of California so it does the job and don't need to buy a bigger sized microsd card for now, I can wait until I need it and by then the microsd card price will go down.The other major issue is I use Google calendar, right now you can use MS exchange to set up google mail, calendar and contacts but it imports ALL of my gmail contacts into my C6 even though I don't actively keep in touch with all of them, I suppose you can choose to update only calendar and gmail and skip the contacts, don't remember if this is an option. The calendar also only updates my main Calendar so others I created, including Holidays calendars, bill due date calendars, etc do NOT get imported. This was a deal breaker for me so I deleted this newly created/added gmail account and all of the contacts and email and calendar got deleted, which is what I wanted and it went back to how it was, being empty. By the way when you import this way, any contacts or information you had in the calendar gets overridden with the new import, so my one contact I created with a photo and all got overridden with the import. I had to reenter it. Anyway my workaround is to use instead of MS Exchange option on Nokia to add Google accounts like gmail and calendar, etc, I used the ""Gmail"" option via the email icon to set up the email account and it works well. As for Google calendar, there is a Google Mobile site and one bookmark webpage you can set up is for Google Calendar, so for my Internet application I set my default homepage as the Google calendar address so when I want to look at ALL (holidays, bills, color coded too) of my Google calendars I just open up that bookmarked web page homepage and it is there updated in real time by Google. As for the Ovi calendar, don't use it, maybe I'll look at it just to see what day it is every sooften. So I get my Google calendar but via a webpage site, not the Ovi calendar because like I said the MS Exchange way to sync gmail mail and calendar and contacts only gives you the main calendar, no other calendars created as discussed above.I also downloaded OVI software to my PC and the linking between the C6 and Ovi software on my PC works well, this is how you sync the photos, maps, contacts, etc from your PC to the C6, also faster way to update your C6 with software updates since you download them from the PC first and then link your C6 to the PC via a USB cable and the data transfer is faster. Otherwise you would have to do it over airwaves on the C6, which is slower even using 3G but you can connect to wifi if available using the C6.I customized my desktop icons, which is pretty cool, I added a couple rows of frequent contacts, then 3rd row from top Gmail, then a couple row of shortcuts below such as web access, a bookmarked web page, calc, camera, last row has messaging icon, then I downloaded an app for messaging, including google talk, from the Ovi app store by searching for ""messaging""--it's called Nimbuzz and with this you choose your account type, Google talk, Yahoo messenger, whatever . . . at first I was lookign and looking for Google Talk app but it does not exist, you have to access Google talk through this 3rd party app Nimbuzz or something else equivalent (it was a free app) and it works perfectly fine. The C6 home screen icons,being Symbian software based, is a bit ""cartoonish"" when compared to more sophisticated phones like the N900 or Droid icons or Blackberry 9000 Bold, but it's fine and the learning curve is not steep to learn to master the C6 menu and navigation as discussed above.Overall I am happy with the Nokia, good size, small bar type smart phone, good looking, quality materials. The C6 is Symbian based and my N900 is Maemo based so another reason I bought both to compare and see how I like them. C6 works with ATT 3G so since I have an existing ATT SIM card it works great, the N900 I signed up for a T-Mobile individual plan text+web+voice and the N900 3G only works with TMobile 3G, So I am set here; if I used the ATT SIM card the ATT 3G does not work with Nokia N900 and would have to settle for EDGE (non 3G).

Moto G Play (4th gen.) - Black - 16 GB - Unlocked,,149.0,5,"I got this a week ago and I seriously cannot get over how impressed I am with this. I bought this to replace a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 that I smashed, and I figured ""alright, I'm spending just $100 on a smartphone so it should just have the basic android functions and get me through until I can upgrade on my contract.""I really underestimated this device. First of all, the Amazon ads are not really annoying. They come up as small bars or full screen ads that you just swipe away when unlocking your phone, and thats all. Next, the swiping is very smooth and I haven't noticed any kind of lag in going between pages. The connection is great and I have not had any problems with cellular or wifi. The picture quality is fine - I have only looked at photographs so far, not films. The battery life is INCREDIBLE. In my casual use, I've been able to go up to 36 hours without a charge, which I think is the best battery life I have ever had on a smartphone. Granted it has only been one week, so we will see how it deteriorates over time.The only cons I can pick out with this phone are the cameras and the speakers. The rear and front cameras are not great, but personally this does not bother me because I shoot all of my content with a DSLR. They're still good enough for shooting things in the moment and posting on Snapchat, but I am not about to try hard to shoot something gorgeous with this phone. As far as the speakers go, all sounds including voice and music come out of the ear-speaker, which seemed strange because iPhones and Galaxies typically have separate speakers for music. My music sounds alright, but I can notice it sounds a little grainier than on my Galaxy.Overall, I'm extremely happy that I spent $100 and got more than I bargained for.",2.0

Samsung Galaxy Note II N7100 16GB Gray-Unlocked International Phone,,116.99,5,"I've had this 'Phablet"" (phone and tablet) since around the middle of December and it has become indispensible!Aside from the usual: camera, video recorder, voice recorder, calendar (which I find so convenient I've stopped using my paper diary), calculator, movie player, music player (total entertainment system really), WiFi, Bluetooth, internet, email, etc.: with the built-in stylus and S-Note I am never without something to jot a quick note whilst I'm on a call, doodle, draw multi-coloured pictures with a variety of nib sizes, or hand write notes in class. I no longer have to carry a notebook to school, I have the notes for four subjects on my fabulous, phablet which I ALWAYS have with me. I can cut and paste from the screen and add it to an SMS or email message; or, whilst on a call, draw directions and send it to the person I'm speaking to with just a couple of clicks. I may sound gushy, but I love this phone! I really don't know what I did before I had it.Apps are unending: recipes, to-do-list, shopping lists, flashlight (using the camera flash), several versions of the Bible, an office app to do spreadsheets, word processing and even power-point, dictionaries, translator, currency converter, Kindle, Skype, you name it, it's on my phone.I bought a 64GB memory card at the same time and have loaded NCIS Series 8 (over 20 shows); Suits series 1 & 2; loads of music and pictures, and around 10 full-length movies so I am never bored.I also bought a Zenus Color Point Wallet Case with it: so . . you guessed it, it's also my wallet, I no longer carry a seperate wallet, i have all my cards in it and a few dollars for cash purchases.I have even sold my iPad 2 as I found I wasn't using it anymore, I can do everything on the Note 2 (ok, the screen's amaller than the iPad, but I can still comfortably watch movies on it), AND without the case full of cards and money, it fits into my shirt pocket.My Note 2 has also replaced my internet service provider as my phone company has 4g, I just tether and use it as a hotspot with my laptop anywhere I go (I have an unlimited plan), and it's FAST, faster than my previous internet service. Did I tell you I LOVE this phablet?Oh yes, the phone works great too. :-) Clear as a bell, great reception, I've been using the headphones that came with it for calls as well as entertainment media as the phablet IS a little large to put to my ear. However, the microphone on them appears to be failing (they have lasted longer than any other headphones I've ever had, I'm pretty rough on them), lately people are saying I sound faint unless I hold the mike to my mouth.Battery life is awesome, especially with Power Saving on, I've gone 3 days without charging if I don't use it as a hotspot or watch a movie (hotspot drains it FAST, even with P.Saving enabled).After 3 months I am still finding new things it can do, or that I can do on it (there's an S-Voice controller, and gesture controls which I haven't got around to using yet).If you just want to make a call, this phone is not for you as the learning curve is kinda steep (I HATED it the first week I had it as I was replacing my BB Torch which had stopped working and it took me a while to fugure out how to use my new android), but if you don't mind a pretty steep learning curve, with total satisfaction at the end of it, this is the device for you.",6.0

"Nokia Lumia 1020 32GB Unlocked GSM Phone w/ 41MP Camera 4.5"" - White - International Version, No Warranty",Nokia,296.0,2,"Top10cell SERVICEBefore purchasing, I contacted Top10cell to make sure the model I would get is the RM-875, the international version. They were very polite and fast in emailing me back with the confirmation. The earliest expected delivery date was Jan 18th, and yet I received it on the 15th for standard shipping. Thus, their service is just simply great.MODEL CHECKINGThere are at least 3 ways to make sure which model is which. 1st, on the box there's a tag where you'll find the supported 4G LTE frequencies. The RM-875 model includes the 2600 Mhz frequencies (according to Wikipedia). 2nd, the RM-875 has radio, which the RM-877 doesn't (according to another site I forgot). 3rd, you can choose from Settings- Extras and info - More info. My phone says it's updated to Windows 8.1 with Lumia Cyan already installed. 4th, the charger is built for European and Asian used, which means the 2 plugs are cylinders, not flat. Thus an adapter is included. Also, you'll find that the manual is in another language other than English (Finnish I believe). You can download the English version online. Really easy.THE PHONEI. THE BATTERYI've been using it for nearly 2 weeks. I downloaded a few games to test the wifi connection, play those games and watch Youtube videos to see how much battery there is. The condition of testing is the same for every time(until it reaches 10% (battery critically low notice, repeatedly with no stop) (I tested 3 times at least):1) Watching HD Youtube clips : 05 hours straight ( I watch an 11-episode documentary called ""Battlefield Vietnam"", each of which lasts on average 50 minutes. I had to watch it closely as Youtube run on IE doesn't switch to the next episode automatically)2) Taking photos (shooting, cropping, uploading them to Onedrive using wifi...: 06 - 6.5 hours3) Listening to Radio Mix: about 08 hours (I played ""Best of 2014"")4) Wait time: >= 1.5 days. There's a clip on Youtube showing a man having this phone on after more than half a day with seemingly a fine amount of battery life remaining. That could happen. I unplugged this phone 02 days ago at 07am and at 06pm today (nearly an hour before I post this review), there's still 24% remaining.5) Charging time: =< 01 hour to FULLY charge, using the original charger (1.5 A output)==> Battery-wise conclusion: I can definitely get AT LEAST 01 DAY out of this phone.II. FUNCTIONALITY1) You'll have Onedrive, Word, Excel, Powerpoint, OneNote ready for nearly any kind of Office work. You can sync your Calendar, Skype,... with other Windows devices of yours.2) There's one thing only to mention regarding the best Camera: it is true as some Youtube clips have mentioned: if you let the phone capture the photo without any selections (ISO, weather, contrast...), the photo may come out a bit too vivid to be realistic. Other than that, if you're willing to learn how to utilize all of these features, you'll have the best phone-mera on the market.3)The app-store is true to be inferior compared to that of Android and iOS, but it can support the common: OneBusAway (OneBusAway for Windows is different from that of Android and iOS, but quite easy to get used to), Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Candy Crush, Temple Run, ... I use it mainly for work and sometimes sightseeing so this is just fine.===> Conclusion: If you use Windows devices for work, need to be up to date on the run, and enjoy taking photos/ shooting HD videos, I think this phone could be a very fine choice of yours.I'll update anything else later. Hope this helps.UPDATE (Mar 30th, 2015)I received it on Jan 05th, 2015, so it's been nearly 3 months since then. I'm updating information about the phone, regarding both BATTERY and FUNCTIONALITY:1) BATTERY: When I discussed this previously, I didn't do the followings: a) Have 2 of my email accounts synced and updated ""as item arrives"" b) Install Twitter, Fb, LinkedIn, Skype, Instagram, Flickr, SurfCube...==> Thus, after having done all of this, the battery is drained significantly faster. For instance, 06 minutes of Skype using Wifi will cost 4% of battery, constantly checking for emails, calendar... will severely dry the juice as well. As a result, this morning I unplugged it at 6am with 100% battery, at 11h00 am it dropped down to less than 10% after my checking emails, using Messenger constantly for less than half an hour, which meant most of the time it stayed on stand-by mode. ( I don't watch Youtube clips, checking Facebook as much as emails, and I haven't had a SIM card for this phone yet as I'm still under contract with another one. I have no idea what it'll be like texting, making phone calls, storing text messages and contacts...) Thus, battery-wise, this is the worst phone I've had, even worse than the last S4.2) FUNCTIONALITY: a) There's no Outlook or Gmail app on the phone, except for one Email app. As mentioned, I linked the 2 inboxes together. This linked inbox doesn't do its job as well as the S4, i.e. emails are updated much more slowly than on the laptop (I'm using an old version Transformer book of Asus). b) Internet Explorer is absolutely crappy. It suddenly crashes when I'm surfing the web or watching a five-minute Youtube clip. SurfCube is better in terms of web surfing, but when I try logging in on Facebook using this, it doesn't load, and it crashes when I watch Youtube clip. c) The wifi reception is even more annoying: It seems like Windows phone can't compete with iOS and Android in this as wifi reception on this phone is inferior to those. I've had to turn off then on the wifi networking just to get signals, or even restart the phone. I don't know how the call and text signal will work, but this wifi reception and the pathetic battery life are annoying me even more than playing Flappy bird.I know what I signed up for. I only didn't expect it to be worse than I thought. If you still want to have this phone, I suggest buying a camera grip, not the Windows one, but the one on Amazon with 3000 mAh ( I don't see it at this point but I hope it'll be back). The camera is a treat, only if you're willing to compromise that much. I'll update after having a SIM card to see what will happen.UPDATE (Oct 18th, 2015)It's been 10 months since I received the phone. My phone has been upgraded from Windows 8 to 8.1 Denim, the latest version prior to Windows 10 for Phone. I've been using a nano-SIM card since May. Here's what been happening:1) BATTERY: I disconnected the linked email account and use only my Outlook with the same update setting (as-it-appears). Watching Youtube from full battery to shutdown is about 3 hours straight (I'm using UC Browser, it automatically plays the next clip on queue). Talk and text don't take out so much juice. Taking photos, shooting videos, web surfing (either by wifi or 4G).... do. Especially, even on standby mode, the battery is still drain, although not as significantly as it used to be. Overall, I can manage to get a day out of it with the following activities: Taking, editing photos (10+ photos), texting, web surfing, watching Youtube. TIPS: I've unpinned all apps, meaning after entering the password (if applicable), the scrolling list appears, leaving no Start screen. I hope it may help save some battery power. Furthermore, adjusting light intensity (Low, Med, High and especially Automatic, which dims the screen when the phone is used indoors and brightens under the sunlight) and Battery-saving options can help as well (though will limit functionalities, i.e. no automatic push mails, Facebook notification...)2) FUNCTIONALITY: a) Bing maps, HERE Maps, Google maps, Maps (pre-installed on phone) are ALL TERRIBLE. No web browser can load Bing or Google map properly, either on 4G or Wifi. HERE Maps and Maps don't have the diverse options like Google maps (bus routes for instance) and sometimes crash. I don't know why, but it's what I've facing. b) The Lumia Camera now allows photos taken in DNG format. As far as I read and experience, it seems to have a better view and more realistic. Taking photos at night time and/or low light situations, against light appear to be improved. Yet, photos are still more vivid and far from what we see.==> CONCLUSION: I'm giving it 3 stars for the improvement, though I believe more must be done, which is easily seen in Microsoft Lumia 950 and 950 XL, coming out this Fall. I think those improvements should be on the 1020.UPDATE: Nov 30, 2015It has crashed twice, i.e. nothing can be done until the battery is completely drained. The 2nd time just happened a few minutes ago, and the screen went awol. If after plugged in, the screen remains malfunctioning, I'll have to send it to repair, which will cost time, money and all of the data stored inside.CONCLUSION: This is absolutely not the type of experience any user wants. Thus, go with the high or low end, don't go with this kind of medium-entry phone.",5.0

BLU Selfie US GSM - Unlocked (Blue),BLU,159.99,3,"Don't get me wrong, this is now a bad phone; It's just that there are BLU phones with more features, promised lollipop upgrades and cheaper price points out there.The premise for this phone is appreciated. It shares the same snapper that is included in the new BLU Life One which is an older model camera, but still takes great shots. The unit has a 4.7"" screen which is offset by a larger form factor which makes the device seem larger than competitors with like sized screens. The screen looks great and shows colors well with no graininess. The form factor is certainly comfortable in the hand due to the size, however, it is oddly rounded at top, bottom and back of phone. The power button is at top, Volume buttons on the left and a single camera shutter button on the right. If you have owned BLU devices before, this is odd as generally the buttons all reside on the right side of the phone. The charging port is angled and set to the far right of the bottom which makes for awkward placement when charging. Considering the price of the phone, $200+, one would expect there to be some pretty nice standout features, (i.e. Tap to wake) Here of which there are NONE.Note: The camera app has many great features as it should with a phone called ""Selfie""!There are other BLU devices out currently that employ a fantastic 8 Core Mediatek processor and great camera, (BLU Life 8XL, BLU Vivo Air) at a cheaper price. This is just a very bland phone for the price you pay.I certainly would recommend this phone at a price similar to BLU's other Flagship-like devices.",0.0

Honor 8 Dual Camera Unlocked Phone 32GB - Midnight Black - GSM - US Warranty,Huawei,399.99,5,"awesome phone for the price, a real iPhone7 contender. from the u toob videos i saw, iPhone7 only beat this phone with loading videos and game playing, by just a tad. works just fine on AT&T by me. i have no issues with this item. in my opinion, this phone is 95% of iPhone7 at half the price. in my opinion, the Honor 8 or 5x is good enough for 95% of smart phone users. every product has pros/cons when comparing to other phones. i cant say much about camera quality because that is not what i use the phone for, all i know is, it takes pictures. as for the GUI, seems fine to me. i did also buy Lwang Nillkin glass screen protector and a silicone case to help protect the phone. batt life seems on par with other phones of similar size. since it is Android i do recommend to put on some anti-malware app, i use a paid-for Webroot subscription that gives me anti-malware and ability to manage the device remotely (tracking, lock, alarm, etc etc).",0.0

BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Smartphone - Unlocked - Yellow,BLU,2000.0,4,"I love this phone! I was skeptical at first because it's not a well known brand but I decided to take a chance with it after buying an unlocked HTC Desire 610 and having it fail miserably. I bought it straight from amazon in pink (the most affordable color! Lucky me! I love pink.) and it arrived in 2 days with no problems. Here are some pros and cons about this phone:Pros-Comes in colors and looks great!-Affordable!-Comes with accessories (Screen protector, case, earphones)-Good amount of internal storage-NO BLOATWARE! #1 reason why I bought this phone. No unnecessary apps come installed besides Google apps but those can be uninstalled if you don't want them. You have no idea how good it feels be be able to uninstall Google+! :)-Decent camera compared to my old phone which was an LG L9-Battery life is great compared to my old phone. At 100% it can last me all day and a few hours the next.-Works smoothly and is pretty fast!Cons-Can't change the lock screen wallpaper, not a big problem but most phones have that option-No keyboard swipe but you can just download a swipe keyboard-The camera can take a while to focus-No 4G LTE but 4G is fast enough for what I do. You can get the BLU STUDIO HD LTE 5.0 if you need LTE its just a few $$ more-No way to remove the Google search bar from the home screens. I got used to it and don't mind it since I use Google a lot.-The only way to wake up the screen is with the lock button. The other buttons don't do anything if the screen is locked.-Uses a standard sim card :( I had buy another sim card since I had a micro-Not many good looking cases for this phone.I have not had any problems with this phone yet. I have also dropped it a couple of times. The case fits snuggly on the phone and I was scared the phone would not have enough protection but so far it's been fine. No scratches, no cracks. One of the best phones I've owned and the most affordable too. I would definitely recommend this phone and will for sure be buying my future phone from BLU. :)",1.0

I initially chose one in Excellent condition but it was snatched up before I took the plunge and bought it. I then chose one that was considered ""Good"". I expected a slightly beaten up but working phone.When I opened the box and prepared for a beat up phone, I was happy to see it looks brand new.

On inserting it asked UNLOCK key to enter. I entered random number to unlock the phone, it was not accepted and there is only 10 attempt to enter UNLOCK key.I called T mobile customer care and I felt that call was outsourced to Philippines.Their answer why they cannot help:Thank you for taking the time to contact T-Mobile. We have received your SIM Unlock Request. Unfortunately, we are unable to process your request at this time. The account must meet the following criteria:1. Subscriber has been active for 40 days since the device was first used on the line2. Must have $50.01 or more in accumulative refills since activation3. Must have device usage within the last 7 days by the mobile number requesting the unlock codePlease submit a new SIM Unlock Request once the subscriber has met the Eligibility criteria.I felt that customer care based in Philippines appears to be interested in finding the reason why they cannot help. It appears that they just read the script. They are good with FAQ.I think when it is pre paid phone and customer has paid full price of phone, it is right of customer to have unlock phone.

BLU PURE XL Smartphone - 4G LTE GSM Unlocked - 64GB +3GB RAM - Grey,BLU,129.99,4,"The Pure XL is a great smartphone it's packed with a lot of features for phone at this price range, here's the pros and cons of my experience with it, First let's start with the pros:*The screen on this thing is brilliant, it's very sharp and vivid also it has an excellent brightness levels and a 1440p resolution that brings a great experience.*64 GB of storage with the ability to expand up to 128GB, 3 GB of RAM to give it a decent performance.*Fingerprint and NFC.now the cons:*Battery life could've been better since it uses a enormous screen that would drain the battery pretty fast if you decide to use it for like 2 hours straight.*24MP Camera can produce some really good pictures and high quality videos but it's not the greatest you'll ever see.*The build quality and design is not the greatest though it's solid and the finishing is pretty decent.*Size... a 6"" smartphone is never great for everyday use and it takes sometime getting use to but if you're a fan of big screens this phone will give you that experience.CONCLUSION:The Blu Pure XLis an absolute beast, with specs way beyond even the excellent OnePlus 2, which can be purchased for a similar price. In reality, the features don’t add up to what promised to be an astonishing phone.The screen is superb, with the camera coming in second as the Pure XL’s other bright spot, and even that’s flawed. Almost every other major aspect is frustrating, broken, or inefficient. Blu sells the Pure XL for $350 without a contract, which is a very good price for a 6-inch octa-core smartphone with a 1440p screen and a 24-megapixel camera. However, don’t be fooled by those on-paper specs. The Pure XL isn’t the amazing buy it pretends to be.",1.0

These apps are something my son would never use. It really takes away the hold ideal of having an unlocked phone. If my son didn't really need a phone right now I would probably send it back.

These challenges probably go with buying a three year old design from an aftermarket dealer. On the plus side, the 4S has a much, much, much, better phone capability than the iPhone 5 series. On my iPhone 5 (dead from a dunking) I was lucky when I could carry on a conversation in our house or inside a building. Not so with the 4S, which is always rock solid. An Apple Tech explained that from the 5 series on, Apple switched to a smaller and less capable antenna to save space and money. Bad choice Apple, very bad.",0.0

CNPGD [U.S. Warranty] All-in-1 Smartwatch and Watch Cell Phone,CNPGD,49.99,1,"From the start it looked nice. I thought it would be great to get a cheap smart watch because I didn't want to spend hundreds on one. It started getting bad once I got into it. You are stuck with only three clock options that you can't change at all and they are all ugly. The function if the watch is slow and never clicks where I want it to. There where no directions with mine so I had to google how to setit up.Also in the description it says all this cool stuff you can do, like stream music through your phone to the watch but that's not true. 90% of what it says it can do you need to insert a separate SIM card for the watch itself. There is no internal storage at all so if you want to store anything you HAVE to have a micro SD. You can not delete or add any apps to the watch so if you don't put in the SIM card you will have a bunch of apps that you can't use. You can get notifications from your phone on the watch but it has terrible settings. You would expect that it would have ring, vibrate, vibrate and ring, and silent. But no they put idiotic names for them for example ""outside"" has it be ring and vibrate. And ""meeting"" is just vibrate. Speaking of vibrate it is terrible. I swear it is louder than the sound. So much stuff moves around in it if you where sitting in class or a meeting and that went off everyone will be looking at you.Overall this watch is garbage and I am returning mine and will be looking somewhere else for a smart watch",3.0

First impressions are that the screen is amazing! Take your LED HD TV and put on a 6+ inch phone. Video quality is awesome! The camera is nothing to get too excited about but it does take manageable photos that are adequate. The photo quality that camera takes most certainly does not meet the clarity and quality that the screen is capable of.The phone requires a micro sim card for T-Mobile. You have to manually setup the 4g network by going through your setting and inputting the T-Mobile network address. I got that off of another active T-Mobile phone.The phone is supper fast and responsive. It is large and can be a little awkward to handle but I wanted a Tablet/Phone so I was expecting that. I would recommend this phone. I have never owned the Samsung Note 3 or Mega but from what I could tell as far as processing speed this phone was just as fast if not faster. I did get a prompt to update the operating the system shortly after I connected to the wireless network.* I have had this phone for a week now. The Battery life is amazing. It goes for ever. I purchased the Sony Case that has the backup Battery pack so it can charge on the go but I am thinking that was not needed for day to day use. The battery is amazing. I have been less than impressed with the speakers. They are average at best but do the job. I think you expect more from the speakers because the picture is so amazing. This is solved obliviously by using head phones or plugging it into some desktop speakers. I need to do some more testing but I think because this is an international version T-Mobile has not been able to dumb it down and restrict it from creating a mobile hotspot. I guess I will find out once I get a bill but I think it is allowing other devices to share the 4g data and I did not have to call costumer care or add anything to my plan.,2.0

"Sony Xperia Z3 Compact D5803 16GB 4G LTE 4.6"" Unlocked GSM Android Smartphone - Black - International Version No Warranty",,244.0,1,"After a couple years of beating the crap out of my Z1 compact I finally managed to break the screen so decided it was time for an upgrade to the Z3 compact. After three months of using the Z3 compact I have replaced the broken screen on the Z1 and gone back to that. Here's why:1) Feel. The Z1 Compact is a more solid feeling device. I have literally thrown it across the room several dozens of times with only a few scratches as result (the broken screen was the result of accidentally hitting an end table corner). Where as the Z1 C has nice aluminum sides, the Z3 C has flimsy feeling plastic. I'd be afraid to have it fall from my pocket, much less be thrown across the room.2. Quality. After less than a month of use the door around the sim card failed. It just would not stay fully sealed, instead it sat ""half ajar"" and this is a compartment that I never had to open except on accident when fumbling in the dark to get to the usb plug. The sim cover now sits sealed shut with silicone sealant. After a second month the usb cover started doing the same thing. Speaking of usb, two months in and you have to have the cord sitting just right in the plug to get a charge, bump the phone slightly so the cord moves and it stops charging.3. Battery. The Z3 sucks down juice when you are doing anything on it. If you leave location service (normal, not even enhanced) running expect a dead phone in your pocket in under 8 hours without having used it.4. Heat. If I lived in a cold weather climate I would love the Z3 Compact. After 20 minutes of moderate use and you can pass it around your skiing friends to thaw them out. It actually gets uncomfortably warm playing games (which must be done while plugged in or your battery will be dead in no time).4. Sony Android Update. The final straw was the android updates which nerfed email for me. Used to be messages from my four accounts would popup in the alerts, click on one and itd bring me to that email (single) or account (multiple new emails). Click the next alert and it brings you over to that message/account. After updates it brings you to the most recent email/account you had open and clears the alerts. Sony released another update shortly after which I had hoped would fix this, but no dice. Just more annoying Sony apps (which granted is on par with Samsung and Motorola crap apps).",0.0

CAT PHONES S60 Rugged Waterproof Smartphone with integrated FLIR camera,CAT PHONES,592.5,5,"Been testing this device over the last few days.Positives1. Battery. This thing is a dream compared to other phones that can barely make it a full day, if that. There are times when under regular use I still have 75% at 5 pm when the device was at 100% at 8:00 am. Mind you this is after optimizing apps to run efficiently but still, it's top tier.2. Build Quality. I was concerned about this as some past Cat phones didn't stand up too well in endurance tests, at least as presented by tests on YouTube. However, the quality of the components is very good. Wouldn't feel bad about dropping this phone. Also the latches on this device are solid, unlike those on some Sony Xperia products. I was concerned about the rear latch opening accidentally under wet conditions but it actually takes some effort to slide the trigger to the side.3. Waterproof. 2 meters and 5 meters if you close off the speakers is a welcomed feature if you're traversing very deep streams.4. Android. Near stock Marshmallow. Aside from Nexus and Moto devices, this qualifies as one of the cleanest installs. There are a few extra apps, but some of them have a purpose, such as the one to clear wet speakers. I was able to either uninstall or inactivate any apps I didn't want to use.5. Custom button. There is an orange button on the left side of the device that you can program to do any desired function. Actually make that functions. For example, it allows for a dual setup of launching a different process or app depending if you short press or long press the button.Negatives1. Camera. The conventional camera is okay but not great. I found it most lacking in low light conditions with grain and a confused auto-focus. Also the stock camera app doesn't allow for true manual mode.2. Display. The display is a lower resolution LCD. Although definitely as great as an OLED Samsung display, it's not bad, but this may matter to some. However, the size is perfect, especially given the extra thickness of the device over conventional phones.In short this is a great device for outdoorsy types or those who work in a demanding environment but likely will not appeal to the general public, which is okay. It does not have the splendid display or a high end Samsung device or the camera but it does deliver on almost everything else. The FLIR camera is a nice bonus if you use it, and it has some practical applications, for example I was able to see the cold vs. hot pipes running the length of our ceiling so may be of benefit to contractors.",5.0

One clean crack across the entire face, rendering it useless because the screen stopped working. If you google it, you'll see this is a common problem. I called Sony and they weren't much help. I couldn't find a phone repair shop in the U.S. that works on Sony phones. I tried to do it myself but kept running into more problems. Bottom line: it's a paper weight.

A 7"" tablet phone, and a Samsung Note 4.I did have trouble initially with the BT software they request you download. After a day of use I kept getting error msgs telling me that I need to install the software even though I had already been connected through it. I uninstalled the BT and BT notifier, then reinstalled a different version, same results.I am now using the Smart Watch WITHOUT the BT software using the Samsung BT default set up.It really makes the tablet phone easier to use since I can leave it in my briefcase and just use the Smart Watch for voice dialing and text msgs, plus my calender alerts.BTW if you use the pedometer... it counts every movement from walking and just moving your hand. it does not have GPS tracking so it can not measure the distance traveled. And if you were born BEFORE 1972 as I was, you will not be able to enter your birth date. I guess the software engineer did not think someone in my age bracket would ever be using this watch. lolAlso there is no way to change from metric to standardOverall a lot of bang for the buck!",3.0

I bought the ""silver plus,"" which has updated software. My calls are very clear. I can call out and receive calls. I can use the calendar, alarms (vibrate or chimes), I can also set the ringer to vibrate or ringtone or both. I can take pictures, record video and voice recordings, and the sound quality is great. I also added a 32G mini sd chip for storage, and the watch has a handy file manager that shows the album covers to all of music, once I select the song. The Fm radio is terrific; the watch comes with a set of headphones that work with the watch, and the software interface is as nice as the ""Brand"" name that this watch looks identical to. (Sams#$% Neo 2 wink) This smartwatch provides an excellent hands free way to receive calls. It has a quality build and the band is a very soft and flexible silicon-like rubber. My only complaint at all with this watch is that it easily synced all the contacts from my iPhone, yet it didn't transfer the numbers, only the names. Still troubleshooting that. For the price, the look, and the fast phone functions on your wrist, this is a great buy and I am hoping it will have a decent lifespan. Will update if anything odd or unfortunate happens.

This phone will not run on AT&T's LTE network, but it will still run on the 3g network there. All I had to do was get a new Micro SIM chip from AT&T and it was good to go. I currently live in Kuwait and that is why I needed the international version. I would prefer to use this phone then the AT&T version.This phone has the quad core process and right at 23GB of usable storage. There is NO MicroSD slot and it uses a Micro SIM chip. This phone reacts instantly when you open a app. The reboot time on it is faster than any phone I have seen.

But I'll skip all the awesome stuff that you've already read about. Let me mention a few of the current downsides.* You must use Microsoft's Zune software to manage music.I prefer mp3 players which act like USB drives. I.e. you plug them in and your filesystem browser displays the contents as regular folders and files. This Windows Phone doesn't work this way.There is apparently some registry hack to work around this, but it would be nice if Microsoft supported this out of the box.* No sleep timer - There are a couple of free ones on the marketplace, but they aren't ideal.* No FLAC support* No OGG support* T-Mobile users: Sending pictures in texts doesn't seem to work.* T-Mobile users: Seems like the data speed is limited to 2G. I don't have a high-end data plan so I'm not so concerned about this. The Wi-Fi speeds are great of course.UPDATE 2011-12-14* I got picture texts to work by installing the Samsung Network Profile app and selecting 'T-Mobile' in it's configuration.",7.0

Nextbit Robin Factory Unlocked Phone - Midnight (1-Year U.S. Warranty),,249.99,5,"I have been cycling through high-end smartphones over the last few weeks trying to find 'the one for me'. And here it is, from left field, the beautiful Nextbit Robin! A stunning phone with great internals and a unique selling point - smart cloud connectivity. I recently got a Blackberry PRIV which is also a beautiful phone with a wonderful hardware keyboard BUT its buggy and inconsistent, runs very hot and is just well, meh! I also tried a Nexus 6P but for me its just too big and lacks any soul, although having the latest Android goodness is always good. The Sony Z5 is a really great phone too but expensive and in some ways, like the screen, just overkill. Well the Robin gives you the best of all worlds; a reasonably stock Android 6 with fast updates, great speakers, a super fast fingerprint reader in just the right place, a beautiful and unusual industrial design and that cloud smart storage. A great concept that smartly manages your storage between the built in 32GB and 100GB of free cloud storage, greying out archived apps but restoring them quickly from the cloud and automatically uploading your photos to the cloud. Hopefully Nextbit will add even more functionality to their cloud implementation moving forward as it has a lot of potential and is just so simple and 'just works' in implementation. I just love the Nextbit launcher, the gorgeous and consistent design of both hardware and software and the thoughtful implementation of Android features. The little cloud logo on the back and the 4 flashing LEDs when it is archiving to the cloud are a nice touch too. All things considered for me its the one! The best smartphone of 2016 so far by far.

I thought it would be great to get a cheap smart watch because I didn't want to spend hundreds on one. It started getting bad once I got into it. You are stuck with only three clock options that you can't change at all and they are all ugly. The function if the watch is slow and never clicks where I want it to. There where no directions with mine so I had to google how to setit up.Also in the description it says all this cool stuff you can do, like stream music through your phone to the watch but that's not true. 90% of what it says it can do you need to insert a separate SIM card for the watch itself. There is no internal storage at all so if you want to store anything you HAVE to have a micro SD. You can not delete or add any apps to the watch so if you don't put in the SIM card you will have a bunch of apps that you can't use. You can get notifications from your phone on the watch but it has terrible settings. You would expect that it would have ring, vibrate, vibrate and ring, and silent. But no they put idiotic names for them for example ""outside"" has it be ring and vibrate. And ""meeting"" is just vibrate. Speaking of vibrate it is terrible. I swear it is louder than the sound. So much stuff moves around in it if you where sitting in class or a meeting and that went off everyone will be looking at you.Overall this watch is garbage and I am returning mine and will be looking somewhere else for a smart watch",3.0
